CryptoCurrency,US crypto hodlers: You have about 2 weeks before the 1099-DA goes into effect.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hg1271/us_crypto_hodlers_you_have_about_2_weeks_before/,12/17/2024,1654,"Just a friendly reminder:  Starting January 1st, 2025 (in 2 weeks), all US exchanges (e.g. Kraken, Coinbase) will start reporting your crypto transactions directly to the IRS via the [1099-DA](https://gordonlaw.com/learn/form-1099-da/).  For pretty much the entire existence of crypto so far, US users have had to self report crypto gains on their taxes (many didn't, or simply underreport). But if you have any sale transactions next year (2025) within the exchange of your choosing, they will automatically be reported to the IRS.  Especially noteworthy: If you have coins that you've held for a long time (e.g. from this year or before) and you sell them next year, the IRS will see that you have **$0 cost basis**. And you will have to show them when you acquired your coins (if it's been too long and you somehow can't find these transactions, then too bad, the IRS will just auto-calculate your cost basis as $0).  For example, if you held DOGE from 2020 and your cost basis is $0.002 (and DOGE is now $0.40), you'll have to provide the 2020 transaction where you bought DOGE for $0.002 and pay all the capital gains on the difference. Plus they'll likely audit your other trades from back then and bill you for any other unreported gains.  **TL;DR**: you have about 2 weeks to tidy up your books, lock in your gains, and make sure you have crypto and USD exactly where you want them to be when January 1st rolls around.","It looks like this post is about taxes.

Plus like any media can be biased and pay to play shyte sometimes  My tldr is flare is a relatively new layer 1 aimed at being the blockchain for data (providing info not storing) in a decentralised way (by numerous data providers rewarded for accuracy rather than single source) and adding functionality with evm to chains currently lacking it.   Specifically xrp, btc and doge are the first it will be applied to.   I think this is huge and hopefully a more productive future where chains, and their communities, can work together and benefit together. Enhancing interoperability between chains and the internet certainly sounds like a good target even with the ever sensible healthy dose of being sceptical of buzz words we should all head.  Anyway as per article biggest initial win could be giving defi to such chains more directly and with less wrapping or handing over keys risks.   Flare has been in development and distribution for a few years now and uses a canary network (songbird sgb) to test code elsewhere before applying to the mainchain (flr) which is an interesting idea.

With initial plans for a memecoin launchpad built on DOGE. With also bringing the possibilities associated with DOGE now being connected to BTC through RGB++  RGB++ has been receiving a lot of interest recently from both the Bitcoin and Asian crypto communities after having first being built for Bitcoin and its very novel approach of 'Isomorphic binding' which requires no actual bridge to the other chain but rather, mapping 2 chains along side each other.  **Quote from recent Techflow article:**  >It is reported that RGB++ will support the $Doge chain in the next step, and will launch the Meme launchpad on the Doge chain after the launch of BTC Meme launchpad. At the same time, he also said that the lightning network is the strategic direction of CKB's long-term layout, which will greatly increase the competitive advantage of the RGB++ protocol. It is worth noting that at present, many teams are not only focusing on the development of the protocol itself, but also promoting the compatibility of their protocols with lightning networks, such as Taproot Assets and RGB. Up to now, RGB++ ecological Meme leading coin SEAL has risen by 50% in 24 hours, and CKB has risen by 12%.  **INTRODUCTION TO RGB++**  RGB++ is an extension protocol based on RGB, utilizing single-use seals and client-side validation technology to manage state changes and transaction verification. It maps UTXOs to Nervos CKB Cells via isomorphic bindings and uses script constraints on the CKB and the other chain to verify the correctness of state computation and the validity of ownership changes.  RGB++ addresses the technical challenges faced by the original RGB protocol in practical implementation and provides more possibilities, such as blockchain-enhanced client validation, transaction folding, shared states with ownerless contracts, and non-interactive transfers.

Why this bothers me so, and why it feels like manipulation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1j5d5v7/the_strategic_bitcoin_reserve_is_established_and/,3/7/2025,282,"Walk thru this with me: Trump campaigns on a pro-Crypto platform and the SBR.  Bitcoins price moves upwards.  When he’s elected the price shoots to $109,000 on expectations of the SBR miraculously appearing out of thin air. Drops because crypto kids are illogical and impatient.  When he’s inaugurated and signing EOs left and right, it shoots back to $106,000 expecting the SBR early, but drops when it’s not.  Now, when it finally happens, the thing that everyone has been anxiously drooling over is signed into law and, of course…  The price of $BTC just drops off a cliff, dragging the rest of crypto, like $SOL, $XRP and even $DOGE with it.   WHAT IN THE (and I can’t stress this enough) FUCK!?  Why?  “But it doesn’t spell it out like I’m 5 that they will be buying a million more tomorrow, so it’s an utter epic failure.”  Ignoring, “The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin…”  This is either manipulation, or there are some paper-handed, TDS infected, lil’bitches out there who are irrational AF. HFSP","There’s so much more to price action than these news items… tariffs, global liquidity, dollar strength, inflation etc","This reaction makes total sense. The emotional whiplash of hyped expectations versus harsh market reality is exactly what we’ve seen time and time again in crypto.  But let’s take a breath and break this down logically.  First, this is a classic case of “buy the rumor, sell the news.” The market is painfully predictable. Big events like this get priced in ahead of time, and when they actually happen, there’s often no immediate bullish catalyst left to keep the momentum going. Traders and institutions take their profits, causing price drops. We’ve seen this happen with Bitcoin halvings, ETF approvals, and now the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.  Second, the SBR announcement wasn’t actually a buying event. People expected the government to start aggressively acquiring Bitcoin, but the executive order’s language is vague. “Authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies” doesn’t exactly scream “buy now,” so traders panicked and sold. The government isn’t some crypto whale making market moves. It’s slow, bureaucratic, and strategic.  Third, crypto traders are notoriously impatient. This market is dominated by short-term speculators who wanted instant action. When they didn’t get it, they dumped. Retail got spooked, momentum shifted, and the cascade began. It’s not the first time, and it won’t be the last.  Fourth, institutional manipulation is always a factor. Smart money plays dumb money in every market. Big players saw the hype, knew retail was loaded up on leverage, and used this as an opportunity to take profits at the peak. Now they wait for the dip to buy back in while retail panics.  So is this manipulation or just bad trading? It’s both. The market is emotional, irrational, and full of over-leveraged traders chasing momentum. But institutions also know exactly how to play the cycle. They are playing long-term accumulation games, while retail plays get-rich-quick games, and retail usually loses.  What happens next depends on whether the U.S. actually follows through and accumulates Bitcoin in a meaningful way. If they do, that’s long-term structural support for Bitcoin’s price. If they mismanage it or slow-roll the process, the hype could fizzle, and we could see prolonged sideways movement.  This was never going to be an instant moonshot. The market did what it always does—overpriced expectations, sold the news, and punished the impatient. Now the real question is whether the U.S. government is actually serious about accumulating Bitcoin or if this was just another round of political theater.",Price goes down = manipulation.  Price go up = market forces.,Hmm wonder what the Secretary of the treasury who is long bitcoin will do,"It dropped because everyone was expecting the gov will start buying btc for the reserve, instead they just won't sell what they currently have, so no buying pressure.

CryptoCurrency,Introducing: The DogeList (Beta) - List for free and find others near you for in-person peer-to-peer crypto transactions anywhere in the world,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1fs6vf5/introducing_the_dogelist_beta_list_for_free_and/,9/29/2024,0,"Hi fellow Crypto Enthusiasts,  We are proud to announce the launch of [The DogeList](https://thedogelist.com/). This site is designed to allow buyers and sellers to post a meeting location anywhere on the map where a person would like to transact using Dogecoin as the currency. This could be a public meetup location like a local bank, or coffee shop, or anywhere you would meet to sell a good or service.  Why Dogecoin? With a high speed, low transaction cost, transferring payment doesn't have to break the bank. Plus, Doge is very fun - much wow!  Key features:  * This site does NOT interact with your wallet or escrow transactions in any way. It is simply a way for people to find locally ""for sale"" and ""wanted"" listings, services, and brick-and-mortar locations that accept Dogecoin for payment. * You enter the item you want to buy or sell or the service you offer and include one (or more) picture(s). You put the amount of currency you would like to receive for the item i.e. $50 USD. The site then posts the item for $50 USD and the equal amount of Dogecoin which adjusts based on the market. * Map based searches. Instead of looking through just a list of items, you get a map-based view as well to see exactly where everything is for sale. Pin drops on the map can be anywhere in your town - choose a local coffee shop or bank as your pin drop to meet up for safety and privacy! * You can choose to be a personal seller where you can sell goods (like used video games, cars, clothes etc) or services (like cell phone repair, dog walking, etc) and meet up at locations of your choice or you can choose to be a business account for brick-and-mortar storefronts. Business accounts have DMs turned off but includes store hours and you can direct people to your store that accepts Dogecoin as payment.  Again, we don't handle any payments or transactions. Buyers and sellers use wallets of their choice in person and don't enter any information like that into the site.  We appreciate any and all feedback! Please feel free to put any feedback here or through our profile links.  Thanks!

Everyone here will claim to be correct endlessly and most of the people here actually end up losing money if you track what they say, or are bots that are designed to trick you into purchasing.   You can use the remind me bot to keep track of people's claims, or a spreadsheet like the one from Google docs.   !Remindme 1 hour yaadi thinks that the people The crypto coin subreddit would have good investment advice   I will get a reminder in my DMs in an hour, You can set different times such as days, weeks, months and years. When somebody makes a claim add their username and their prediction to your remind me comment cuz a lot of the losers will delete it afterwards, and rarely some of the winners will also.   Eventually you get a sense of who knows what they're talking about and of what well thought out opinions sound like, and you might learn how to do some of the strategies they are describing.   If you want to start purchasing immediately? I would stick to bitcoin and ethereum.    Neither of them has left the top two spots for a good amount of time. Bitcoin has an incredible brand and many fanatical followers, ethereum has the largest development community, The most established tech stack that people have now been learning to program for a decade and many projects and layer 2s  and other assets that are being traded on top of it.   You could also try to actually use the coins for anything, this is not great for short-term price predictions, but even if the price is bad if it's something that's useful, it won't be a total waste of money. You will have a use for it. This will also protect you from 90% of s***** projects that never see any use.   The final thing I would say is the market looks very precarious right now and it might crash. if you're in good coins, they'll recover. If you're in random things that have come out in the past couple of years, they might not. It's a common pattern in the industry for something to have a year or two of hype until finally a crash comes along and it never recovers what it was before. This has happened to every ethereum competitor.   You need to mentally prepare yourself for when it crashes, if you're going to hold for multiple years, you will have to hold through several crashes.

But I've noticed that some high market cap alts like XRP, SOL and BNB have reached ATH before ETH did. I was there in the last bull run and I don't recall stronger alts making ATHs before ETH. Maybe some smaller ones did, or some new projects went crazy like Solana. But most of prior top 10 started becoming dinassours, Monero, Dash are first on mind.

There might be another alt season by the end of 2025 but that one is not guaranteed.","I was also here the past 2 cycles and this is actually eerily similar.  2020-21 had its share of alts that spiked a few weeks before ETH really got going - XRP was one of them before it crashed back almost immediately.  Look at the XRP chart for November 2020. It went up 400% and then plummeted lower than it started. And by early 2021, ETH was booming.  Be patient","Naw, feels the exact same.   Line goes up and suddenly everyone is pretending like they know shit about fuck.

CryptoCurrency,$220.344M Liquidated From The Crypto Market in Last 24 hours,https://i.redd.it/saapqknnmrce1.png,1/13/2025,443,"What a way to start the week right? With a lot of REKTs. In the past 24 hours, 220.344 traders were liquidated with a total liquidations in $538.86M... The largest liquidation happened on Binance BTCUSDT with $8.21M liquidation.  From the heatmap we can see that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) took the lead in total liquidation volume with $112.69M and $106.20M, respectively. However, Others category that represents altcoins is not getting behind surpassing both with a total of $128.82M. Alts proportionally bleeding more than the big two. Other important alts like SOL, DOGE, XRP are also experiencing significant bleedings.  Even thought I expected a rally looks like the market is priced in the incoming events data like US CPI and maybe other bearish future news that at least I am not aware of.  If you believe in crypto in the long term, you will see this as an opportunity to load a bit more in a cheap price before things get again bullish. I think we are currently getting close to the real bull run and it is not a surprise to see this kind of dumps during January.  Let see what future has saved for us, stay safe, trade safe and don't let the noise and FUD blur your goals.  Source: [https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData)",The liquidations amounts becoming less and less...

CryptoCurrency,"Considering the news, should we convert our entire portfolios to the 5 'golden' cryptos announced for the crypto reserve or it's a bad idea?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1j1zh5b/considering_the_news_should_we_convert_our_entire/,3/2/2025,46,"Considering the news from orange man, I'm not sure how certain is this crypto reserve and can it be somehow stopped by congress ? Or Trump has more than enough people on his side to get the approval, is it almost certain at this point ? While I understand there may be other cryptos also included,  he specifically mentioned just these 5.  In my case I have Polkadot,Doge, Near, GRT, is it smart idea to convert to SOL? Considering SOL reached 290usd last month without these crypto reserve news, I'm guessing it would be no issue for it to reach 450-500 usd very soon.  However,  Im also thinking,  if ETH hits 5k from it's current price (2500$), that's just 2x, if it hits 10k, it's 4x. But for Polkadot I'm having hard time imagining it wouldn't go 6-7x if eth is at 10k, even if it's not part of the crypto reserve I believe it would still push hard.

At the end of 2023, the value of the **AMKT** provided by Alongside for the Experiment was donated to [The Michael J.

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT).  AMKT is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, AMKT is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.    Here’s the question I tracked this year: would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?  On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.23 AMKT.  Here’s the snapshot, one year later:   https://preview.redd.it/3rlaqyrpz5de1.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=61b89692c1f882f7e6a39eee9828e4138b2b640e  December Performances:  * The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio: -9%  * AMKT: +9%  The monthly victory goes to: The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)  FINAL TALLY FOR 2024:   * The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio: current value $1,902 (+90%)  * AMKT: current value $2,052 (+105%)  Overall winner: The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)  For the more visual, here’s the table I used to track the friendly Top Ten vs. AMKT competition this year:  https://preview.redd.it/k8girkuoz5de1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e84556410fb85492faec54e0f3724f40766804b  That’s a wrap on the 2024 Top Ten vs. AMKT competition.  For the second year in a row, AMKT took the overall lead.  Quick summary:  2023: AMKT returned +141% vs. my Top Ten’s 73%  2024: AMKT returned +105% vs. my Top Ten’s 90%  Not bad for doing nothing.  # Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios   The 2024 Top Ten is one of seven concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?  * [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +66% (total value $1,660) * [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +733% (total value $8,331) * [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +997% (total value $10,975) (best performing portfolio) * [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +371% (total value $4,707) * [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -4% (total value $958) (worst performing portfolio) * [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +221% (total value $3,208) * [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +90% (total value $1,902)  Taking the seven portfolios together:  After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, the combined portfolios are worth $31,741  https://preview.redd.it/4pfu0cknz5de1.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=879ed8cd2352f14cab965bca7442e1e32bcc6a8c  That’s up +353% on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [November 2021’s all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of +533%.    The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio remains tantalizingly close to break even point for the first time since its inception in January of 2022 at -4%.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:  https://preview.redd.it/vitaw5rmz5de1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=86101edd710d708b91f803c8a11040a9dff2c9b1  In summary: That’s a +353% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years.  # Comparison to S&P 500  I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.  https://preview.redd.it/n3395rdlz5de1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=db61fb9db0561c9679c0d913d3c4a0e126b1dbdc  The S&P 500 is up +23% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,233 had it been redirected to the S&P.  Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,201 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,347 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,821 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,566 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,234 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,532 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,233 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:   After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,934.  That is up +70% [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a +353% gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:    https://preview.redd.it/hb9o01jkz5de1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=75ddd36a29a277ad275cd7be8c1de3f793119180  # Conclusion:  That’s a wrap for the first year of the 2024 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment.  It ended up being a very solid year, despite some bumps along the way, par for course in crypto.  To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,143 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,286 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,774 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,525 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,202 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,492 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,201 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:   After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,624.  That is up +66% [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a +198% gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:   https://preview.redd.it/gxsewmbwio0e1.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=27f6d4120455fa01809aff5f9b1f8b21d746ab3e  # Conclusion:  To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long.

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.    Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***  On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Eleven months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot:   https://preview.redd.it/59ks6if0x76e1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=f77732246c255b4b3925223c7afe33b8182d80ba  **November Performances:**  * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: +89%  * **AMKT**: +34%  The November monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**  **Overall since January 1st, 2024:**   * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** \+110% *  **AMKT:** \+88%  Overall lead: **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**  A very interesting month for indexooors.  Experiment followers may notice that this is the first month in two years that the **Top Ten Portfolio** has taken the overall lead from **AMKT** and the first month the Top Ten has held both the monthly and the overall victory columns.   This is undoubtedly because of the outsized gainz of both **ADA** and **XRP** in November which are each purchased at an even distribution model (10% each) in my Experiment vs. the market cap weighted approach of **AMKT**.  As much as I’d like to flex, I predict my outperformance will be short lived, given the data from the last two years and the fact that **AMKT** is coming up on its quarterly rebalancing soon.  For the more visual, here’s the table I’m using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:  https://preview.redd.it/r2z6w362x76e1.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=0de3c67df1c4c31115faf8cc387e2b1681d259ff  # Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios   So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?  * [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +79% (total value $1,789) * [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +756% (total value $8,559) * [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +999% (total value $10,994) (***best performing portfolio****)* * [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +369% (total value $4,694) * [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -1% (total value $991) (***worst performing portfolio****)* * [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +248% (total value $3,483) * [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11): up +110% (total value $2,100)  Taking the seven portfolios together:  **After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$32,611**  **That’s up +366%** on the combined portfolio.

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.    Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***  On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Eight  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot:   https://preview.redd.it/izxh5m8ty5od1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=92574fcc54b7e91ba146701d6051e0fee13e135a  **August Performances:**  * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: -14%  * **AMKT**: -18%.  The August monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Experiment**  **Overall since January 1st, 2024:**   * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** -5% *  **AMKT:** +7%  Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**.  For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:  https://preview.redd.it/d5s7z05vy5od1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ac9fd14c951946a6d997896c0e4cf452d0ee97  # Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios   So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?  * [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): down -7% (total value $927) * [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +400% (total value $5,001) * [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +617% (total value $7,172) (***best performing portfolio****)* * [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +165% (total value $2,650) * [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -51% (total value $488) (***worst performing portfolio****)* * [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +54% (total value $1,539) * [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up -5% (total value $946)  Taking the seven portfolios together:  **After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$18,722**  **That’s up +167%** on the combined portfolio, the lowest level since [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:  https://preview.redd.it/cjb73jbxy5od1.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddbadf0addedbe13bc3aca8c409a0b8105184dd5  In summary: ***That’s a +167% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.  # Comparison to S&P 500  I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.  https://preview.redd.it/j66ublz2z5od1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9c24e32ff2b61320982158a863acd6480eebb94  The S&P 500 is up +18% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,180 had it been redirected to the S&P.  Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,110 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,250 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,750 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,190 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,470 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,180 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:   **After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**  That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+167%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:   https://preview.redd.it/wb9vc2a4z5od1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=8086a62642ba07b5504e3c8d71e34a62d8fd8b8e  # Conclusion:  To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long.

CryptoCurrency,Meme Coins Are the New Dot-Com Bubble—And They’re Fucked,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1iu23iu/meme_coins_are_the_new_dotcom_bubbleand_theyre/,2/20/2025,75,"Meme coins are basically the dot-com bubble on steroids—same hype, same bullshit, just with more Twitter influencers pumping garbage. Back in the ’90s, slapping “.com” on a company name was enough to send stocks soaring, even if the company had no business model, no revenue, and no real plan. Sound familiar? Remember Pets.com? Went public with a $300 million valuation, dead a year later. eToys? Worth $8 billion at its peak—bankrupt in months.  Now fast forward to today, and we’ve got the same circus with meme coins. Dogecoin, created as a literal joke, hit an $88 billion market cap—bigger than some of the biggest companies on the planet. Shiba Inu, another pointless token, once flipped Doge in valuation. And let’s not even talk about the thousands of useless meme coins that pop up daily, each promising to be “the next big thing” while offering absolutely nothing. It’s all just glorified gambling with fancy dog logos.  And trust me, I’ve seen this shit before. I bought eBay back in the day when it was dirt cheap, but like an idiot, I sold it for a small profit instead of holding on. If I had kept it, I’d be sitting on a fortune. But at least I was investing in something real—an actual business with revenue, not some pump-and-dump meme coin that’s just gonna vanish when the hype dies.  And here’s the kicker—just like the dot-com crash wiped out 90% of those garbage stocks, the same fate is coming for meme coins. The second regulations hit and the big money moves on to actual projects with real utility, all this meme coin bullshit is going to collapse. Sure, a few might survive, just like Amazon and Google did after the dot-com crash, but the rest? They’re fucked. And the only people left holding the bag will be the ones who thought this shit was gonna last forever.",No they are not.  They are pump n dumps mostly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, one month later:   https://preview.redd.it/cai0brxy1bje1.png?width=227&format=png&auto=webp&s=527600a5a248fa851922b1157ea4c25fce7e9d3a  **January Performances:**  * **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: +7%  * **COIN50**: +3%  The January monthly victory goes to: **The Top Ten Portfolio**  For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:  https://preview.redd.it/9q830vvz1bje1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=de397f412f75383d8a51776f8da4474de69bb9ad  # Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios   The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?  * [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +73% (total value $1,725) * [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +761% (total value $8,612) * [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +1010% (total value $11,098) (***best performing portfolio****)* * [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +391% (total value $4,911) * [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up +5% (total value $1046) (***worst performing portfolio****)* * [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +240% (total value $3,399) * [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +100% (total value $1,998) * [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +7% (total value $1,066)  Taking the eight portfolios together:  **After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$33,855**  https://preview.redd.it/s8v0vci12bje1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf7abe1e229b0ac861308ffbb4d021049b16acc  **That’s up +323%** on the combined portfolio.

The S&P 500 is up +3% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,027 had it been redirected to the S&P.  Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,260 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,411 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,870 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,608 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,268 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,574 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,266 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,027 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:   **After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,284.**  That is up **+66%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+323%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:    https://preview.redd.it/413iyng32bje1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecf84d31cb1e54b35f382ea779cfc009c59476f0  # Conclusion:  Not a bad start to the year for crypto, we’ll see what 2025 holds for the Top Ten Portfolio.     To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.   A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1) \+ one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  January’s extended report is on the [OG 2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85).

CryptoCurrency,"Is anyone actively trading? And if so, why?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h4xevw/is_anyone_actively_trading_and_if_so_why/,12/2/2024,2,"In 2021, I made 15k trading crypto, mainly cardano and doge. But the sad thing is, crypto crashed thst same year and I pulled out NOTHING, resulting in me paying about 2k in taxes. This was because i was re investing the money, and not taking profits.   I want to trade right now, but with the year being so close to over, I want to hold out. At the same time though, when I see coins like xrp making 200% within a month, it makes me want to try trading, because I could always make that short term gain tax money back I'm sure, or maybe that's the gambling side talking.   Is anyone trading currently?",Everyone is a genius in a bull market,"I don’t get the logic where you go from ‘XRP making 200% gains’ to ‘that makes me want to start trading’.  I’d very strongly advise against it. You’re more likely to end up with zero than any gains. Trading is not some get rich quick scheme, whatever anyone one else - especially on socials - tries to convince you of.",">I pulled out NOTHING, resulting in me paying about 2k in taxes  ummmmmmmm",I’m not good at short term trading. I ended up with net loss on short term trading. I have done really well trading halving cycles though.   Most lose money when trying to do quick trades. I’m just glad I been blessed with patience. Good luck!,"(Apologies for all the edits)  It sounds like you need to follow an objective approach, because right now you're letting your fear drive you. Take your total worth (ignore what it's currently in) and decide what % of your portfolio you think each asset should have, based on risky that asset is, and how much risk you're willing to take on. Then buy the proper amount to meet that %. And if you're only comfortable with an asset at <5%, then you need to drop it completely. You won't be able to micromanage assets at that small an allocation. If this means you only get to select 8\~10 assets, then so be it. I personally only hold 6 (including USD).  For instance, if you feel like the only CCs you're willing to hold are USD (yes $), BTC, ETH, and XRP, and you feel like BTC and ETH are pretty stable, but XRP is a little too risky, then maybe set your %s at 20/30/30/20. So if you have $5k total portfolio value, then you want your portfolio to look like this:  |Asset|%|$| |:-|:-|:-| |USD|20%|$1,000| |BTC|30%|$1,500| |ETH|30%|$1,500| |XRP|20%|$1000|  Then, as those assets swing in relative value, re-balance. But keep those %s. You decided those based on an objective analysis. You don't change them just because one asset spikes. You don't *have* to make USD a part of your portfolio, but if you don't then you wont be able to truly profit from swings in the entire CC market. You will only profit from swings between CCs.  If you decide to invest another $1000, then you dont adjust your USD %, you buy your assets based on your allocations, to keep your portfolio balanced.  Overall this means as the market goes up, you don't HODL. You slowly sell, back to USD. Then as the market goes down, you slowly buy back in. Buy low, sell high - the only way to win. But the key is to come up with an honest evaluation of those % allocations, and stick to it. Changing them every 6 months is no different than what you're likely doing right now.  You also don't need to rebalance unless things get off by a certain amount, maybe \~10%. That means you're sometimes going to have to sit it out when you see that magic green arrow with a \^5% next to it. You don't go buy and sell just because a chart looks nice. You do so only when your portfolio is out of balance, period.  If, after a year or two, you come to the conclusion that you were wrong, and that some asset is just far too shitty / risky, then drop it and move the allocation elsewhere.  But back to your question - is anyone trading. Yes, I am. I am selling XRP. Why? Because it spiked and has become an unacceptable % of my portfolio. Is it nice that it's worth more, sure. But *I dont want* that much of my total worth to be in something with that much risk. So when It spikes, I trade some (not all) of that value to other, less risky, assets. I spent the last 5 years slowly buying it, as it's price fell relative to other CCs. And when it inevitably falls again, I'll buy it back. The difference is, i'll be able to buy *more* the next time around, because I moved some of that value to something more stable.",0.3939,0.3699,0.0,0.4886,0.0,0.831,0.9945,3.0779,6.1558
CryptoCurrency,Crypto-Backed Loans AMA with Lantern Finance Cofounder Jung Won Kim,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lebb1k/cryptobacked_loans_ama_with_lantern_finance/,6/18/2025,14,"https://preview.redd.it/4ve2itdmmq7f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c5a3367599d1661dfcc94464d6acd3b8a8bf76a  **tldr: I'm Jung, cofounder of Lantern Finance (**[**www.lantern.finance**](http://www.lantern.finance)**), a US-based crypto lending platform built in response to the 2022 collapse of lenders like BlockFi and Celsius. Unlike them, we never rehypothecate collateral and store all assets in insured cold storage with BitGo.**  **We support loans straight to your bank account against BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, LTC, DOGE, and more. Our mission is to offer the safest, most transparent crypto-backed loans. AMA and would love any feedback!**  Hey r/CryptoCurrency!  My name is Jung, and I’m one of the founders of Lantern Finance, a US-based crypto-backed lending platform. I got started into crypto in 2016 and fell deep in the rabbit hole, having played around with several projects and platforms. In particular, I became a huge fan of BlockFi when I found out about them in 2019. The ability to borrow dollars against my crypto without selling and triggering capital gains taxes in a convenient custodial way, appealed to me.  However, fast forward to 2022, we all know what happened. The entire space imploded as we found out that crypto lenders like BlockFi, Celsius, and Voyager were rehypothecating (lending out) client collateral on an unsecured basis. They were basically double dipping - making money on the loans we took out as well as the crypto collateral we posted. I, along with millions of others, lost a decent chunk of our hard-earned crypto.   That experience inspired my cofounders and me to build Lantern Finance ([www.lantern.finance](http://www.lantern.finance)). Lantern is a US based crypto backed lending platform that prioritizes safety of client funds over profit. Here is how we do things differently:   * We hold borrower collateral in cold storage with BitGo, a US based qualified custodian, with insurance up to $250MM.  * We NEVER lend out borrower collateral - they just sit in insured cold storage.  * We lend against a broad group of blue-chip assets like: BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, LTC, and DOGE. If there’s an asset you want to borrow against that we don’t support, let me know!  * Our goal is to offer the most secure, convenient, and seamless crypto-backed lending experience for everyone.  My experience spans traditional finance, the (relatively) early crypto days, the crypto implosion of 2022, and now building Lantern, a fast growing crypto startup.  **Ask me anything and feel free to share any requests like: specific crypto you'd like to borrow against, product or features you'd want, or just general feedback. Thanks for your time and looking forward to engage!**",Do you borrow against stables?,"Do you provide a watch only address so that your clients have transparency that the asset you are holding for them in cold storage remains untouched? (This would have the added benefit of allowing them to securely generate receive addresses for increasing capital in the event of an LTV mismatch for example).  What LTV are you currently offering, and how often is this to be reviewed to maintain pace with macro changes in market volatility.  What is the basic boiler plate structure of the legal agreement between yourselves and your clients (no need for detail, just the contractual structure you're using)?  Are you answerable to any government agency or regulator that could freeze or seize your assets? I am assuming that for the purposes of any legal agreement, the assets deposited as collateral are legally recognised as your assets for the purposes of forfeiture or seizure whilst you are holding them.  What is the structure of the insurance contract, and how much are you overvaluing the insurance of assets to account for growth during the pendency of your custody? Is it simply insurance that would pay out to you upon the loss of assets, or is this insurance provided to the client that requires that you pay an agreed value if the assets are not returned in line with the contractual agreement?  Does your insurance cover digital security breaches resulting in loss, or bad actor loss (i.e. a member of your team decides to compromise assets, either directly by theft, or by facilitating theft)?  Who provides recourse to a client if your business fails or activities are otherwise suspended by an event like government seizure? i.e. which institution or regulatory body is protecting clients if you act in bad faith?","If the DOJ (or law enforcment in gerneral) asked you to freeze a users funds, would you?","Can people outside USA use your platform?

CryptoCurrency,Remember. You can always sell a portion of your holdings. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Make a plan.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h5qk9h/remember_you_can_always_sell_a_portion_of_your/,12/3/2024,165,"I constantly read people say, “Oh just my luck, I sold all my XRP to go into purple unicorn (or whatever it is) just 6 months ago! I can’t believe I missed out on this. Just my luck!”  Remember. You can always sell a portion of a holding when you hit a price target. You don’t have to liquidate the asset entirely. The key though is to have a plan, otherwise you’ll be second guessing yourself constantly with the daily/weekly pumps and dumps.  My plan? I sell a third of all my assets when the total market cap hits 4 trillion. I sell another third when the total market cap hits 7 trillion. Right now I’m not buying anything unless the total market cap dips below 2 trillion.   I’m not saying this is a great plan, just what I’m doing. Make sure you have a plan or else you’ll be doing the flip flap trader stuff that will screw you over in the long term.  What I’m realizing more and more with each cycle is that no one really knows what’ll happen with different assets. It’s incredibly hard to pick winners. About a year ago I posted my portfolio and was clowned on. My general strategy? The majority of my holdings are in BTC and ETH. I then have a basket of the big L1s that can handle volume.  I own a total of 26 coins. Alts make up a much smaller % than BTC and ETH.   For years people have said SOL & ADA are shit, XRP sucks, ALGO is mid, DOGE’s inflation is ridiculous, XLM and LTC are washed. Tbh, I think pretty much all cryptos are stupid including these. But I still bought them because ultimately I don’t know what will play out long term. But I figure that the gains from 1-3 coins will pay for the losses of the rest and it’s worked out so far.  Unless you’re only in BTC, I really hate the “concentration is the way to go bro, otherwise you’ll dilute your gains” perspective. Because how do you know you’re right? Look at EOS or NEO. How do you know that you picked the right winners? Now should be said, how do I know that I picked the 26 correct winners? I don’t. But generally speaking, I’ll model my portfolio after what Grayscale does so that at the least I’m riding the currents of the institutional players.

CryptoCurrency,A company that steals: Freewallet,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kuu0ib/a_company_that_steals_freewallet/,5/25/2025,33,"Hi everyone, Posting this today to bring visibility to a company that is stealing from investors, it’s called Freewallet. It goes without saying DO NOT use Freewallet, and if you already are…well good luck getting your money back.  This is how it’s worked for me. Freewallet snuck into their terms and conditions that the wallet is not in fact free and that they will charge you approximately $30 USD per month for their wallet if you become “inactive”. They don’t warn you that they are about to charge fees when you hit their mysterious inactivity criteria and on their lovely subreddit they justify this by saying everyone should read all the terms and conditions.   I had a nice stack of doge that I decided to check on with the market rise and it turns out these scammers have stolen a value of 4 figures worth of doge from me-but wait! There’s more!  Upon learning my doge was drained without warning or my consent I tried to immediately remove all my remaining doge and my transaction failed as my account was suspended due to “suspicious activity”, ironic considering they were draining my wallet due to inactivity. After almost two months of waiting, I finally posted on their subreddit and customer service got back to me and made me send in documents to verify my identity-but wait! There’s more!  Despite me logging in they have continued to charge inactivity fees even though there is literally NOTHING I can do to remove my money from this fucking “free” wallet. They authorize transactions to themselves but block investors from doing what they want with their own money! But wait, there’s more!  They are currently holding up releasing my funds due to the fact that I can’t provide a screenshot from ANOTHER exchange showing my funding transaction, a completely illogical step in the verification process (I used cryptopia-dead exchange) given my identity is literally verified.  Please sign this petition to help those of us who are getting fucked by Freewallet. r/Freewallet_org is filled with people in my situation although Freewallet does their best to hide the situation by deleting posts and banning words like “stealing” and “scam”. Weirdly enough they actually take the time to respond to posts, granted it’s usually just excuse making.  https://www.change.org/p/investigate-the-fraud-committed-by-the-owners-of-freewallet-org-26bd95f7-cfbc-4fa3-a24d-9d1692737ff7  TDLR: Freewallet is a scamming and stealing company fuck these guys!",It's not even your wallet/ crypto if they take from it with out you signing a transaction. Those funds are gone...,"Their ""features"" are indeed red flags.    I cracked laughing on what they present as ""features"":   1. Social network/email required -> you should stop right here! Any crypto ""supposedly"" wallet that requires you to insert this data is to be discarded.   2. Private keys held by freewallet -> not your keys, not your coins!   3. ""Right to make a mistake"" -> I believe they're referring to deposit anything to them, because that's a huge mistake already.   I believe you got yourself a very expensive lesson, but all their ""features"" screams ""we are a bunch of scammers"".

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.    Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***  On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Seven  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot:   https://preview.redd.it/y664h9b2fmjd1.png?width=394&format=png&auto=webp&s=a546df7df80d244c01690a04571c1d99d5654699  **July Performances:**  * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: -1%  * **AMKT**: -2%.  The July monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Experiment**  **Overall since January 1st, 2024:**   * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** +10% *  **AMKT:** +31%  Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**, with over triple the ROI of the Top Ten Portfolio.  For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:  https://preview.redd.it/amts88b3fmjd1.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d2e96578c65b6ec6cfc50291b598f82495b6a0c  # Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios   So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?  * [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +12% (total value $1,102) * [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +470% (total value $5,697) * [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-50): up +736% (total value $8,357) (***best performing portfolio****)* * [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +203% (total value $3,033) * [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -43% (total value $570) (***worst performing portfolio****)* * [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +77% (total value $1,775) * [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-7): up +10% (total value $1,102)  Taking the seven portfolios together:  **After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$21,637.**   **That’s up +209%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:  https://preview.redd.it/9ec71uv5fmjd1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=0523e8b58b85ee48dbe45a3503f20b1d1bbbebcb  In summary: ***That’s a +209% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.  # Comparison to S&P 500  I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.  https://preview.redd.it/me55u1s8fmjd1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8b315d24836f27f95edbed6b5f0f673ea288561  The S&P 500 is up +14% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,140 had it been redirected to the S&P.  As of August 1st, the S&P would have been a better place for my initial $1k than my Top Ten Crypto investment.  Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,040 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,170 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,690 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,450 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,140 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,420 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,140 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:   **After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,050.**  That is up **+58%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+209%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:   https://preview.redd.it/u8aac6r9fmjd1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcc5d2bd3343f482fa2b3c21f3064302b8c59f9e  # Conclusion:  To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long.

And that made sense in the beginning  because in the early days of crypto it was fun, not related to money(crazy amount of money at least), people were genuinely interested in the projects and most of the people involved were honest and for a lack of a better word ""Naive"".  Meme coins like doge were created for fun.   But as crypto started pulling serious money in we started to see the cracks due to the lack of set rules. We should have learned from Mt. Gox that we needed more safeguard instead people just kept denying the need for rules and regulations.   And here we are with some of the craziest rug pulls, pump and dumps and manipulations taking place and honestly no one can do shit. the general masses are gonna lose millions and the process they will pad the well padded. By fighting for deregulation people have effectively put power in the hands of scammers, grifters and any other person who is out there to screw you over.  Everyone benefits from fair regulations.

CryptoCurrency,Free money (for me) Glitch???,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1j3qiva/free_money_for_me_glitch/,3/5/2025,0,"Hear me out, because I'm tired of calculating this over and over, and I can't figure a single way to lose money.  So, let’s assume I have 40k USD worth of ETH or DOGE on Binance. Binance is offering a flexible loan at a 6% annual interest rate to borrow USDT against ETH at 70% LTV (Loan-to-Value).  To be safe, I take the loan at 50% LTV, so I now have a 20,000 USD loan at 6% annual interest. I could simply borrow against my funds at 6% and put that in my local bank, which offers a 20% interest rate.  That's a straight 14% profit without selling my Ethereum, and I can still profit from it if the price of ETH rises, right?  If Binance's interest rate ever hits 20%, I can just withdraw cash from my bank and repay the loan on Binance, avoiding any losses.  The only risk is liquidation, but for that to happen, ETH would have to drop to $800. And even if that happens, I can just buy the same amount of ETH at that price and diamond hand it (Unwillingly, i have strong diamond have)  So how is this not easy money? How could I actually lose money here? It seems so easy to get rich this way that my mind can't believe it.   Am I missing something guyss??","Yes, no legit bank offers 20%",What bank would give out a 20% interest? There’s no way.,"In addition to the liquidation risk you mention, you need to factor in the risk of your country's currency depreciating against USD.  You need to factor that in.  It's a good bet considering USD weakening is likely in the next year, but it isn't free money.  This is an investment strategy with risk involved, but it may be genius.","The 20% is probably coming from a currency that goes down 40% towards the dollar every single year.   Most currencies are losing against the dollar, recently. Like post-COVID.    If your loan is in dollars, you're going to have to pay back dollars, which means you're going to have to use your currency to buy dollars. Look at a currency chart and see if three years ago you could have done that.","So you live in a 3rd world country that gives 20% on your local currency?

The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:  https://preview.redd.it/4bu7v5hrqbvd1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=64cdb13580c7aded3d3b04a7ed9486bdfe07903a  In summary: ***That’s a +196% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.  # Comparison to S&P 500  I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.  https://preview.redd.it/1j0sksisqbvd1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=42d015c34b7167c1f63d664ab2d71c7b26b04577  The S&P 500 is up +20% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,197 had it been redirected to the S&P.  Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,136 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,278 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,767 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,520 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,198 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,487 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,197 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:   **After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**  That is up **+65%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+196%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:   https://preview.redd.it/m1vd0fntqbvd1.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cd79daf20d6c9d6b65bafdcf9ea4c124ff5d5a1  # Conclusion:  To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long.

CryptoCurrency,Starting my journey,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hu5qy5/starting_my_journey/,1/5/2025,14,"So today I'm probably going to purchase my first Bitcoin.  I plan on deposit £240 all into Bitcoin and I plan on using Crypto.com for it. I've done a bit of reading into Crypto exchange apps and a lot of people recommended Kraken or Kraken Pro, however - I also see a lot of people mentioning they are investing in HBAR and Kraken doesn't seem to have that in their system.  I also plan to buy some other crypto like ETH, SOL, LINK, DOGE, SHIB, XRP, ANKR, SUI, ADA, USDT, TRX  Those are the ones I've heard the most about and have in my watchlist so would love your thoughts on them or any others. I'll probably put something like £50 into each a month, not sure on that yet.  Should I use Crypto.com to buy all my Crypto, including HBAR or should I forget about it and go ahead and use Kraken? I've not checked all those coins I listed to see if they're on Kraken.  28m, UK",Very solid plan.  But I would recommend decreasing your list of altcoins radically. It was also my mistake to invest into way too many alts last time and I still have to search for exit options on some of the underperformers.  Stick to just some.,"Just remember, behind everyone who became a bitcoin only type buyer is someone who had a buy list like yours with coins from a past cycle long forgotten.  They watched all the coins ""other people talked about"" slowly grind to obscurity.  We all have to find out that bitcoin only isn't a meme ourselves before we truly get it.","Did you do any research on these coins? Why so many?  You remind me of the guy that posted here 5 days ago who said ""i ThOuGhT dIvErSiTy WaS GoOd"" and then proceeded to throw money at the weirdest most obscure coins that nobody had heard of. He was asking why he had lost money, but he's since deleted his post in shame.  First of all... **USDT**? That's a coin whose literal function is that it can never go above 1 US dollar. Now given that you're from the UK, you might be betting that GBP weakens compared to the USD in which case USDT could indeed net you a profit in terms of your home fiat currency. If that was your intent all along, fine. But something tells me that it wasn't.  I would consider having a portfolio of 33% **BTC**, 33% **ETH**, and 33% everything else to be a portfolio of someone who is extremely aggressive with risks and irresponsibly heavily-invested in too many altcoins. Anything even more skewed than that is just lighting money on fire. Don't you dare come back six months later and cry, ""wHy dId I lOsE mOnEy?""",CDC and kraken are 2 of the best CEXs out there. I'm not sure they have all the tokens you've listed but good luck with your journey :),"It sounds like you are at the beginning of your Bitcoin journey and understanding. Don’t worry, we have all been there. We were all brought up in the Fiat system, and all had to go through a mental shift to grasp Bitcoin. Before you buy ANYTHING, I have compiled a shortlist of videos that i highly suggest you watch to aid your understanding. Add bitcoin as your base knowledge before expanding to other cryptos, because quite often you will find that all your efforts with other cryptocurrencies is to obtain more bitcoin.   Clip #1 gives you a good basis of understanding for Bitcoin, Clip 2 is the most important video here, because it lets you understand the context of what sound money is, and understand money vs currency better, which ultimately helps you understand the value of bitcoin, and previously gold. Clip 3 is a bit advanced, but when you’re ready, is a powerhouse strategy, while clip 4 shows you where fiat money is headed.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,212 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,359 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,830 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,574 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,240 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,540 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,239 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,005 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:   **After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,000.**  That is up **+63%** since January 2018 compared to a **+265%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:    https://preview.redd.it/y61vs3hnbe7f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7f0ab63d11010b1208c57d3a8ecf524f76be426  # Conclusion:  To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, take care of your family, yourselves, and try to enjoy the ride.   A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  May’s extended report is on the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio.  For more data, you can check out the latest 2018-2024 Top Ten reports as well.","Sorry for the delay this month, it's been a crazy June so far for me and my family",Good work sir!,Monero is up since 1/1/25. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/  Sometimes the best opportunities are not in the top 10.,Excellent analysis!

I remember in 2017 when some of the big bullish news during the bull market were things like the launch of CME for Bitcoin. But mainly, the bar was still low at ""wow look at all these new Bitcoin ATMs"".  In the 2021 bull market, people were really bullish on things like Elon jumping on Doge coin and NFTs.  But keep in mind, for every major piece of bullish news we had, there was a hell of a lot more FUD and bearish news within crypto.  In 2017 and 2021, we still had institutions and governments wanting to clamp down on crypto at every turn.  Countries like India banning the use of crypto.  China banning crypto mining.  We had the media painting crypto in a very negative light, and we had a lot more FUD headlines about the space than what we see today.  But we had nowhere near the level of bullish news we have now with major institutions jumping on crypto, ETFs actually getting implemented, major legislative red tape getting removed, the media being more neutral and sometimes positive in their portrayal of crypto, major progress in utility and adoption on the tech side, and even countries adopting crypto and starting a race to build crypto reserves.  We went from countries putting out legislation to clamp down on crypto, to countries wanting to build crypto reserves.  All the while, the only major negative news in this space we've had so far that comes to mind is the Bybit hack. Which has already blown over and has been forgotten.  But the bullrun and all the bullish outlook has been held back by one giant problem that has held bulls like a giant dam: Trump's tariff war.  Traditional markets are reacting the same way, with fear, and bulls being stopped dead in their tracks.  That barrier has been stopping the market and holding back the crypto bullrun like a giant dam.  In the unlikely event those policies are resolved, it would be like a dam collapsing that was holding back a stampede of bulls crushing shorts on their way out.",We’re past the point of a quick uno-reverse by ending tariffs.

CryptoCurrency,Do the price fluctuations this week matter in the long run?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1j3cfxq/do_the_price_fluctuations_this_week_matter_in_the/,3/4/2025,9,"So I’m super new to crypto, like I just started last week. I’ve always wanted to but now that I’m old enough and finally have a decent amount of my own money, I thought I would put some money into crypto knowing nothing other than “Bitcoin is worth a lot”.   So I’ve invested about 1,4K dollars spread over Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Algorand, HBAR, XRP, Shiba, Doge, Jupiter, with my highest monetary investment on ALG HBAR XRP SOL.   Anyways, I invested a lot right before the surge on Sunday, and then didn’t sell because I thought it would keep going up. Then I bought some more when it dropped on Monday, but waking up today and I’m down around 200 dollars, since I bought a big chunk last night right before everything went down.  Disregarding how bad my strategy was and of course no one having the real answer, does it even matter if I bought when XRP, for example, was at 2,2 and now it going down? Selling now would be stupid right, as everything should rise in the long run?  I’m not sure if I should pull the plug on SOL and ETH and transfer during the dips now to others like XRP, since I’ve read around and that one seems most likely to explode.  I’m in it for the long run, however I have this tendency to keep checking changes and it’s making me crazy, especially when being down so much money already (haven’t sold anything yet).  Idk, just wanted to get the thoughts of some more experienced people. Maybe the question is dumb lol. Thx anyways!

CryptoCurrency,rCryptoCurrency has been sleeping on Moons. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h996jb/rcryptocurrency_has_been_sleeping_on_moons/,12/8/2024,0,"It seems inevitable, a coin pumps and people come to this sub to find out why, and for those that buy they have to hope it doesn't retrace. This post aims to give you the down low on Moons before that pump when people inevitably flock to the sub and ask ""why are Moons pumping?"". (I started writing this post when Moons were $.15 but am in the middle of a move so didn't finish it until today.)  I'll do my best to offer an unbiased take that covers both the good and the bad of Moons.  # What are Moons?  If you aren't brand new to Crypto you've probably already heard about Moons to some extent. Moons are a governance token for r/cryptocurrency launched by Reddit, before they later sunset their involvement, burned their Moons, and renounced the contract. Hard locking supply and making Moons deflationary through the buy and burn engagement processes created through community governance. For more information on Moons check out the wiki (which may or may not be up to date: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons\_wiki/)  # Breaking it Down:  **The Good:**  **Perhaps a few of the most positive aspects of Moons are:**  ·       **Brand Awareness**  ·       **Low Marketcap (lots of potential upside)**  ·       **Deflationary through multiple buy and burn mechanisms**  ·       **Being a Governance Token for one of the single larges point of entries for new/upcoming CryptoCurrency enthusiasts.**  **The Bad:**  ·       **Top Heavy Holders**  ·       **Amateur Reddit Whales**  ·       **We don’t pay entities for listings/marketings**  **Both Good and Bad:**  ·       **Community Lead**  **---------**  # The Good  **\* Brand Awareness and a top-notch ticker:**  Although Moons aren’t known by those outside the world of CryptoCurrency they’re pretty well known by CryptoCurrency enthusiasts, and every time a new entity buys and burns Moons another entity and their community becomes aware of the usecases and utility of Moons.  Also let’s get something straight the ticker ‘Moon’ is top notch.  **\* Low Marketcap and the potential upside:**  In the world of CryptoCurrency the current marketcap of a project can help third parties decide if a project has potential upside or not. The marketcap of Moons Is astronomically small compared to most projects 18.4 Million, or in other words 184 BTC.  *That isn’t to say a low marketcap guarantees upside but find another low marketcap crypto that is as well known and has as big of a community as Moons.* **You cant!**  **\* The Deflationary Mechanisms of Moons**  Let’s talk about Moons Circulating Supply! When Reddit was part of the project a decreasing amount of Moons were minted every month to be distributed. After Reddit sunset their involvement and burned the contract. Moon supply became capped and any burns decrease the circulating supply.  rCryptoCurrency offers various engagement options where approved entities can burn Moons for various forms of utility on the sub – such as hosting giveaways / running AMAs / customizing the banner. In fact 1% of Moons have been burned through this mechanism YTD. Moons burned through this process are often purchased off of the open market.  Additionally a portion of the funds used to purchase .moon domains from Unstoppable Domain (currently paused) will be directed to Moon burns.      **\* rCryptoCurrency and the greater role in the CryptoCurrency ecosystem.**  Moons started as a governance token for r/CryptoCurrency, where holders of the token can vote on governance for the subreddit and earn Moons through participation on the sub. These mechanisms by themselves bake the awareness of Moons into all users who participate on the sub.  Combined with the fact that r/CryptoCurrency is the single largest CryptoCurrency community on the internet this adds a whole new level of depth to the long-term value of Moons. Although many of these users may be off and on-again retail, some of these users will go on and embed themselves as builders in the CryptoCurrency industry, and empower the next generation of CryptoCurrency builders with the knowledge and awareness of Moons if nothing else it creates an abstract value proposition for the future.  # The Bad:    **\* Top Heavy Holders:**  With Moon Circulating Supply being \~79M total Moons, one only need 790K moons to hold 1% of Moons supply and with Moons being deflationary that number will decrease as time goes on. Although no one but a handful of Mods were able to earn 1% of the supply through the previous Reddit distribution model, many users such as myself were able to earn close to . 2% of the current supply through long term participation on the sub ""Moon Farming"" .  Given the fact that Moons are incredibly cheap and at one point dropped to around a 2.5M marketcap when Reddit sunset their involvement. There is a rightful concern to how many Moons were either earned or bought up by whales for cheap and their ability to sell and suppress price movement.  **\* Amateur Whales:**  Moon volume has never been completely consistent although we are now at the point of basically having \~$100k a day volume – total volume fluctuates and the ability to buy/sell without creating huge price movement can fluctuate. This wouldn’t be particularly concerning if it wasn’t for Amateur Retail Reddit whales loving to market sell an entire position causing huge price fluctuations and potentially suppressing price discovery.  If you’ve been around Moons for awhile you’ll know of “Moon Farmers” who would market sell 120K+ Moons positions dropping the price $.07+ during price discovery.  \* **We don't pay for Marketing / Listings:**  Did you know lots of companies like Binance, Kucoin, etc... will allow companies to pay for listings, and Crypto news companies will write sponsored content about projects in exchange for payment? This isn't something that Moons has or does. Although mods control a multi sig wallet that covers distributions we don't pay for any formal marketing or listings.   # Both Good and Bad  **\* Community Lead:**  Moons are Community Lead by volunteer moderators and members of the community and that might be Good or Bad depending on how you look at it.  Users and Mods are incentivized to make Moons better and to help grow the community as to expand value propositions for outsiders and to increase the value of the tokens that they hold.  In this way Moons are like the early community of Doge. We love our community and we volunteer our time to try and help build and grow our community. Being community lead we don’t have financial backers or VC firms to help our growth. It’s all up to us.  \----------------  Note on circulating supply:  *Although it is true that Moons are deflationary with the circulating supply having dropped over 1% so far in 2024 that doesn’t mean Moons will increase in value. A decrease in supply means price would increase if demand stays constant or goes up. Of course there is no guarantee Moon demand will increase or stay constant. Moons often go through wild swings of demand which creates price volatility and demand can fluctuate wildly.*  Disclaimer: in December 2023 when Moons were \~$.13 and still recovering from the sunset drama I recognized Moons as being undervalued for the reasons stated above and converted my entire crypto portfolio to Moons. I will look to convert some of those Moons back into BTC in the future.  TLDR: Moons imo have insane value prop but there is rightful concern about top heavy holders and Retail whales.  Final note: Despite being long this is a very surface level approach to the value prop of Moons, there is a lot more to know for those wanting to find out about the project.",i like the way you stonks,"IMHO Moons have made this sub a very weird place. People wrote bots to downvote posts. I mean,  how come you have so many comments, yet zero upvotes? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)",">Did you know lots of companies like Binance, Kucoin, etc... will allow companies to pay for listings, and Crypto news companies will write sponsored content about projects in exchange for payment?

Never had a problem until yesterday..  I sent myself one of the largest crypto transactions I've done but its still TINY compared to other people.  I sent myself $413.76 in dogecoin from an external wallet I own.  The transaction now has over 1000 confirmations on blockchain and is clearly a confirmed transaction.  However for some unknown reason Robinhood decided to ""review"" my transaction and now even though the transaction is confirmed on blockchain its been in review for over 20+hours.   I will gladly edit this post and say its resolved if they can just release my funds but I just don't understand why a few hundred dollar received transaction with over 1000+ confirmations could be under review for so long.

CryptoCurrency,Why You Should Consider Buying Moons,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h9453z/why_you_should_consider_buying_moons/,12/7/2024,0,"Alright, r/CryptoCurrency fam, let’s talk about Moons. No, not the ones in the sky. The ones we’ve been earning, tipping, and memeing about here on this subreddit. If you’re not paying attention to Moons right now, you might be missing out on what could become the next big thing. Let me break it down (with a sprinkle of humor and a dash of seriousness).   🚀 Why Moons Might Actually Be Worth Buying  1. Fixed Supply, Growing Demand  Moons are capped at 250 million total supply, but here’s the kicker—no new Moons are being minted anymore. That’s right, this is a deflationary asset. Add to that the fact that Moons are burned with every transaction, and you’ve got a recipe for scarcity. Think of it like Pokémon cards but with less cardboard and more crypto nerds.   2. The Great Decentralization Move  Reddit said, “Moons, you’re free now, go live your best decentralized life,” and Moons left the Vault system for the wild, wild Web3. This means no corporate overlords dictating their fate—just us, the community. Decentralized = infinite possibilities, including integrations into broader crypto ecosystems.   3. Utility Beyond Just Reddit?  Okay, hear me out. Right now, Moons are mostly used for tipping, voting on subreddit governance, and flexing your crypto wealth. But what happens when someone decides to integrate Moons into NFT marketplaces, DeFi platforms, or metaverse economies? The possibilities are endless. A Moon-backed game? Pay for merch with Moons? It’s all on the table.   4. Look at the Price Action  Moons are currently trading at $0.19–$0.26, with a market cap of just ~$28 million. Compare that to meme coins with billion-dollar valuations and no utility (looking at you, Dogecoin). Moons have surged over 67% this week alone. It’s volatile, yes, but it’s also alive and kicking.   5. Token Burn = Rocket Fuel  Every transaction burns Moons, and no new ones are being created. This deflationary mechanism means supply decreases while demand grows. Less supply = 🚀 (in theory, anyway).   TL;DR: Why Buy Moons?  Moons are no longer just subreddit points—they’re evolving into a real asset with deflationary supply, solid community backing, and the potential for utility beyond Reddit. Whether you’re here for the memes or the moonshots, Moons might just be worth a closer look.  So, what’s it gonna be? Are you buying the next Doge, but smarter, or sitting on the sidelines? Discuss below, and may the Moons be ever in your wallet’s favor.",I think we've seen enough posts about moons for one week,MOON hype is really back huh...,do i have moons?,"Small mcap, hard capped, real use cases, memeable name logo and means of earning:  If r/CryptoCurrency Moons had Baby Doge Coin's  market cap of $701.0M, 1 MOON would be worth $7.95, an upside of 35x  If r/CryptoCurrency Moons had dogwifhat's market cap of $4.0B, 1 MOON would be worth $45.03, an upside of 203x",People seem to either love moons or absolutely hate them.

CryptoCurrency,Why Fartcoin is going to $2 - an anal-ysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lkrro5/why_fartcoin_is_going_to_2_an_analysis/,6/26/2025,0,"Let's be real - at the end of the day, all anyone cares about is which crypto will to what price, so they can make money.  Well you're in luck, because I've got a price target for you - Fartcoin to $2!  Let's dive in to the painstakingly analyzed data behind that price target.  The most similar coins we can use to establish a fair market value (FMV) are other memecoins, such as DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. These coins have market caps of $24.7B, $6.8B, and $4B respectively. Fartcoin trades at a huge discount to those at a marketcap of only $1B.  Also, while AI tells me that 45% of global households like dogs, 100% of people in the world fart, thus having the total addressable market for farts over double that of the dog coins! This is a FACT - my friend had a girlfriend fart on his balls once, so even if girls claim they don't fart, we know it's not true. Everyone is in the market!  Farts have strong meme potential - farts have been a meme for over a thousand years in Japan! Just look up He-gassen on wikipedia.  To give an idea of how attainable $2 is, here's some other unknown and bullshit shitcoins that have >$2B market caps: ICP, Bitget Token, ONDO, Kaspa, Bittensor, OKB, APT, etc. Everyone would call those shit coins, and a fart is better than a shit.    If you believe farts are at least half as much in the public zeitgeist as Pepe the frog or a third as much as doggies, riding farts to $2 is a solid bet. And if you think it's stupid and worthless, well, a fart coin is worth as much as a USD in your bank account right now, so it's no joke.

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.    Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***  On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Six  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot:   https://preview.redd.it/jzxy2nx7oybd1.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=752d4be3e5f72ec4db9d76274ea4f9db11fc9807  **June Performances:**  * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: -9.9%  * **AMKT**: -10%.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,050 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,180 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,700 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,460 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,150 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,430 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,150 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:   **After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,120.**  That is up **+59%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+216%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:   https://preview.redd.it/hs10jm6hoybd1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=26e4593d768c95195e7ca759da33c6433163488b  # Conclusion:  To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long.

What am I missing here? Sure, some inside investors could have dumped, and Trump very well has every intention to dump, but wouldn't it make more sense for him to dump AFTER pumping it for a few months?  Also, we all know how these memes work, especially the big dogs, like Doge. When the biggest celebrity attached to them mentions anything positive about them or any sort of future utility, they pump like crazy. Whether we like it or not (and this is coming from a non-Trump supporter), Trump is the biggest celebrity on the planet, and arguably the most powerful man on the planet.

CryptoCurrency,Mixed feelings about Strategic Reserve plan,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1j367e8/mixed_feelings_about_strategic_reserve_plan/,3/4/2025,7,"Hello guys,  I've been thinking about this strategic reserve plan for a while now and, like most you, got also excited when the ""semi-official"" announcement came in last Sunday.  Prior to this announcement, there had already been some arguments saying that such a State-owned strategic reserve goes totally against the very purpose of crypto. Originally, the goal of basically all crypto activity was to create an alternative away from governments, decentralizing the systems and empowering the users.  Governments are now seizing these spaces for themselves - be this the main driver or rather other purposes, from downright speculation to reduce their debt or really for the sake of having an alternative reserve without the logistical hassles of gold.  Be it as it may, the whole market seems to have found peace with this and embraced the narrative as it ""legitimates"" crypto towards the ""disbelievers"" - and helps pump up the price.  However, the undoubtedly suspicious signs of insider trading happening around the announcement show that the US government's work in favor of crypto has been, at least partially, to enable advantages leveraged by inside information useful for trading (and let me recall that the SEC cannot investigate insider trading on crypto if they're not classified as securities).   Moreover, choosing coins for the reserve like ADA, SOL, XRP and even ETH that, as good/solid as they might be, were created to serve way different purposes than serving as a reserve asset. Heck, they should have mentioned the TRUMP coin already then. Or DOGE... Anyway, you get the point.   What I wanna say is that this means that this whole hype around this pro-crypto government might just backfire epically. It will not take long before this kind of episode becomes main topic of a ""Last Week Tonight"" show and crypto becomes synonym for corruption, which means a legislation crackdown will follow latest after the next elections.  Therefore, I am basically considering this cycle the biggest there will ever be, because everything after 2026 will point towards more legislation, less institutional adoption and/or centralization.",Tangem—The Hardware Wallet You Can Rely On. 🔐  We are excited to be hosting an AMA/Giveaway on rCryptoCurrency!

Just wanted to get one thing straight that google hasn’t been able to answer. When I report my income do I still have to pay the capital gains taxes even though I haven’t converted it into fiat and withdrawn to my bank account? I honestly think it’s BS if I have to pay capital gains on a conversion I made even if I sold the btc and bought the doge, I didn’t take any of the profit in cash so why should I have to pay out of my salary?

Which is different than the memecoin cycle of 2021.  While we’ve seen some of this back in 2021, notably with Elon pumping doge, this cycle will have this on steroids with governments and banks jumping in. Not on solana memecoins, but on random established coins.  Trump pumping SOL, ADA, and XRP is not automatically a good thing. While I believe new ATH are inevitable for these coins, the fact that it was announced while crypto was dumping means they have most likely already bought major bags and knew these news will cause a reversal. Elon appeared to use the same tactic multiple times in 2021 with doge. The ultimate Influencer move.  Don’t forget crypto lacks major regulations against fraud and the entire crypto-sphere was and still is riddled with fraud. Using tax payer money to create the reserve and create hype and FOMO, and then eventually dump their initial bags, profiting from the very same reserve that was created.  These projects are not even fully decentralized and can be manipulated and not just price wise, the actual protocol can be changed overnight. XRP is notably hated on reddit ever since it was created in 2012.   Not sure where I want to end with this gibberish, but I’ll just say a few more things.   Influencers use their clout to lure you in while they start dumping on you. TikTok influencers are the worst at this and will dump their  memecoin within hours. Also watch out for those that lure you into their telegram/discord groups that claim to know which memecoin to pump. It’s literally the same idea, it’s all a sham while they have bots that sell faster than you can blink.  Same thing will happen with Mark Cuban’s coin if that ever gets released on these pump and dump platforms. You, the average user, have very little chance to profit from this and most of you will buy the top contrary to all those TikTok’s of 16 years olds becoming millionaires overnight.

For crypto to be useful to the average person, it needs to become more like a credit card.  Offline hard wallet, with payment terminals connected to the blockchain.  The user taps on the terminal and receives a transaction, which they can sign and push back to the terminal, which forwards the transaction to the blockchain.  Let the hardware wallets accept payments to and from each other, that, when linked to a phone through bluetooth, the phone can add to the blockchain.  hardware wallets should also offer tap-to-pay for normal debit cards as well, so the user doesn't have to rely solely on crypto.  It isn't hard to see why crypto isn't taking off, when it's a literal walled garden to the average person's needs.  I want to go to the store and buy something. I don't want to worry about scanning codes, connecting to the Internet, typing in exactly how much should be transferred, etc. I want to walk up to a coke machine, tap my hardware wallet against it, and out pops a soda. I want to tap my friend's hardware wallet against mine and transfer funds. As long as one of us is connected to a phone with working Internet, the devices shoud honor the transaction. And I want to see my balance on my device.  Also, your rule section is outdated.

Hardware wallets are generally used as cold storage. Adding something like tap-to-pay requires the wallet's signature.

CryptoCurrency,Top 10 most popular cryptocurrencies by Google queries and their prospects for 2025–2030,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k6urfa/top_10_most_popular_cryptocurrencies_by_google/,4/24/2025,0,"In recent years, cryptocurrencies have taken on an important place in global financial systems, and their popularity is only growing. In 2023, several cryptocurrencies became leaders in Google search queries, reflecting the interest and attention they attract from both institutional and retail investors. In this article, we will look at the most popular cryptocurrencies of 2023, including Bitcoin (BTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Cosmos (ATOM), Polygon (MATIC), Dogecoin (DOGE), EOS (EOS), Cardano (ADA), BNB (BNB), and, of course, Qwadrox (QWRX). We will also attempt to forecast their growth and assess their prospects for the next five years.  # 1. Bitcoin (BTC)    **Bitcoin is rightly considered the first and most popular cryptocurrency. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has become a symbol of the decentralized financial system. In 2023, Bitcoin remains the leader in market capitalization and the number of Google queries. It is a cryptocurrency that currently appears stable and reliable, despite market volatility.**  # Reasons for growth:  * **Global acceptance: Bitcoin continues to be adopted at the country and large corporation levels. It is used as a store of value (digital gold) and as a means of savings in countries with unstable currencies.** * **Limited supply: Bitcoin has a strict limit of 21 million coins, creating scarcity and supporting its value.** * **Institutions and ETFs: The ongoing integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system through futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) significantly increases its liquidity and stability.**  # 5-year forecast:  Bitcoin is likely to continue strengthening its position as the main cryptocurrency, and its price could reach $150,000–$200,000 by 2028, given the ongoing interest from institutional investors and global recognition.  # 2. Shiba Inu (SHIB)    **Shiba Inu is a cryptocurrency that gained popularity due to its meme nature. Although it was created as a joke, Shiba Inu quickly captured the market and attracted the attention of traders and investors looking for short-term profit.**  # Reasons for growth:  * **Community strength: A large and active community has formed around Shiba Inu, actively promoting the token and supporting its price.** * **New projects: Shiba Inu is gradually evolving, expanding its ecosystem, including the creation of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and its own metaverse (Shiba Inu Metaverse).**  # 5-year forecast:  Shiba Inu will continue to attract attention from speculators, and in the short term, there are likely to be sharp price fluctuations. However, long-term growth depends on real applications in DeFi and other areas, and the price could range between $0.00001 and $0.0001.  # 3. Ethereum (ETH)    **Ethereum is a platform for creating decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, and one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. Ethereum continues to evolve and improve, and its influence on the blockchain technology market is undeniable.**  # Reasons for growth:  * **Transition to Ethereum 2.0: The shift from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will significantly reduce energy consumption and increase transaction speeds.** * **Growth in DeFi and NFT usage: Ethereum is the primary blockchain for many DeFi applications and the NFT market, contributing to its steady growth.**  # 5-year forecast:  Ethereum has strong prospects for the next five years as its technology becomes increasingly scalable and efficient. The projected price by 2028 is between $10,000 and $15,000.  # 4. XRP    **XRP is a cryptocurrency used for fast and cheap interbank money transfers. It was developed by Ripple Labs and is actively used by major financial institutions.**  # Reasons for growth:  * **Partnerships with major banks: XRP continues to gain popularity among financial organizations looking to reduce costs on international transfers.** * **Regulatory clarity: After long legal proceedings with the SEC, XRP has a chance to gain a clearer legal basis, which will increase trust in the currency.**  # 5-year forecast:  XRP could show significant growth if all legal issues are resolved and partnerships with banks are expanded. The price could range from $5 to $10 in the next five years.  # 5. Cosmos (ATOM)    **Cosmos provides a solution for inter-blockchain communication, allowing different blockchains to exchange data and assets. This makes Cosmos an important player in the market.**  # Reasons for growth:  * **Inter-blockchain communication: Cosmos addresses the problem of blockchain isolation, making it a platform of the future.** * **Attracting developers: The project actively works with developers, fostering the creation of new and innovative decentralized applications.**  # 5-year forecast:  Cosmos could become an important part of the blockchain ecosystem, especially if technologies for interaction between different blockchains start to dominate the market. The expected price by 2028 is $50–100.  # 6. Polygon (MATIC)    **Polygon is a second-layer solution for Ethereum that significantly improves scalability and reduces transaction costs.**  # Reasons for growth:  * **Integration with Ethereum**: Polygon actively collaborates with Ethereum, providing scalability for its applications and expanding the ecosystem.  * **Popularity of DeFi and NFT: Polygon is used by many DeFi and NFT projects, increasing its significance in the market.**  # 5-year forecast:  Polygon is likely to continue evolving within the Ethereum ecosystem and become one of the leaders among second-layer solutions. The projected price by 2028 is $5.  # 7. Dogecoin (DOGE)    **Dogecoin is a meme coin that became popular due to its humorous nature and the support of well-known personalities like Elon Musk.**  # Reasons for growth:  * **Community strength and celebrity support**: Dogecoin continues to have enormous support from its community and well-known personalities such as Elon Musk. **Continuous improvement: Despite its meme nature, Dogecoin is actively developing and could become a stable cryptocurrency in the future.**  # 5-year forecast:  Dogecoin will continue to be volatile, but if it remains popular, its price could rise to $1–2.  # 8. EOS    **EOS offers a high-speed platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. It aims to address scalability issues faced by other blockchains.**  # Reasons for growth:  * **High throughput**: EOS offers significant performance, making it attractive to developers.  * **Support for large projects: EOS is actively used by large companies and projects, increasing its value.**  # 5-year forecast:  EOS will continue to evolve and improve, offering new opportunities for dApps. The projected price by 2028 is $5.     # 9. Cardano (ADA)    **Cardano is a blockchain platform focused on security and scalability, using a scientific approach to develop its technologies.**  # Reasons for growth:  * **Research-based approach**: Cardano employs research and testing methodologies, attracting developers and investors.  * **Potential for global application: Cardano is actively developing partnerships with governments and large organizations, which could lead to widespread adoption.**  # 5-year forecast:  Cardano will continue to develop innovative solutions for scalability and security. The projected price by 2028 is $10–$15.  # 10. BNB    **BNB is a token used in the Binance ecosystem, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.**  # Reasons for growth:  * **Usage in Binance**: BNB is actively used to pay fees on the exchange, stimulating demand for this token.  * **Development of Binance Chain: Binance continues to develop its own blockchain network, increasing the significance of BNB.**    # 5-year forecast:  The price of BNB could reach $1,500–$1,800 in the next 5 years due to increased demand for its use within the Binance ecosystem.  # 11. Qwadrox (QWRX)    **Qwadrox (QWRX) is a relatively new cryptocurrency that is actively attracting investor attention. The project focuses on creating solutions for scaling and enhancing the security of blockchain systems, combined with philanthropy.**  # Reasons for growth:  * **Innovative technology**: Qwadrox develops unique solutions for blockchain ecosystems, making it promising.  * **Partnerships with major companies: QWRX actively collaborates with industry leaders to implement its solutions in real life.**  # 5-year forecast:  Qwadrox could take strong positions in the blockchain market. If the project continues to develop its technology and attract new partners, its price could reach $1 and above.",ChatGPT could really do with some updated information.

CryptoCurrency,Survival of the Fittest in the Blockchain Ecosystem,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gsg9p2/survival_of_the_fittest_in_the_blockchain/,11/16/2024,18,"I’ve been thinking about how Darwin’s theory of evolution, specifically “survival of the fittest,” might apply to cryptocurrencies. I know, analogies most of the time are stupid. Still, if we imagine cryptos as living organisms in a digital ecosystem, only the strongest and most adaptable are likely to survive in the long run.  So, how does this analogy work?  In nature, species that adapt to their environment survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits. Similarly, cryptocurrencies that adapt to market demands, technological advancements, and regulatory changes are more likely to thrive.  Let’s look at some examples:  Bitcoin (BTC): The Digital Pioneer - Analogy: Bitcoin is like the first species to colonize a new environment—it’s established and has a significant advantage due to being the first mover. - Survival Traits: Widespread recognition and adoption as a store of value. Despite scalability issues, solutions like the Lightning Network are helping it adapt.  Ethereum (ETH): The Versatile Adapter - Analogy: Ethereum is akin to organisms that evolve new functions to exploit different niches. - Survival Traits: Introduced smart contracts, enabling a whole ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). The transition to Ethereum 2.0 aims to improve scalability and energy efficiency.  Tezos (XTZ): The Self-Evolver - Analogy: Tezos is like a species with the ability to self-mutate to adapt quickly to environmental changes. - Survival Traits: Features a self-amending blockchain that can upgrade without hard forks, allowing it to evolve smoothly. On-chain governance lets stakeholders vote on protocol changes, ensuring collective adaptation.  Cardano (ADA): The Research-Driven Species - Analogy: Cardano resembles species that evolve carefully through gradual changes backed by research (think of humans developing advanced tools). - Survival Traits: Built on peer-reviewed research and formal verification, aiming for long-term scalability and security.  Dogecoin (DOGE): The Unexpected Survivor - Analogy: Like the cockroach, which survives in various conditions despite the odds. - Survival Traits: Started as a meme but gained a strong community and widespread popularity, showing that community support can be a key survival factor.  Just as in nature, the crypto environment is competitive, and resources (like investment and developer attention) are limited. Cryptocurrencies that can’t keep up may become obsolete, much like extinct species.  So, what do you think? Am I too off? Which cryptocurrencies do you believe are best equipped to survive?","This is clearly a Tezos shill post. Tezos is not even a top 100 coin.   Not to say that it can’t make a comeback, but I feel Tezos has already been nano’d","> Tezos is like a species with the ability to self-mutate to adapt quickly to environmental changes.

CryptoCurrency,Chinese New Year Buzz: Why Chinese Crypto Investments Could See a Massive Pump,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ia9tt3/chinese_new_year_buzz_why_chinese_crypto/,1/26/2025,0,"With the Chinese New Year just around the corner, the crypto market is buzzing with anticipation, especially among Chinese-linked blockchain projects and meme coins. Historically, the festive season has brought renewed optimism, increased trading volume, and speculative pumps for projects tied to Chinese innovation or culture. This year is shaping up to be no different—and perhaps even more exciting.  # The Chinese New Year Effect  Every year, as the Lunar New Year celebrations begin, the market tends to see heightened activity. This cultural and symbolic time, marked by themes of prosperity and renewal, often encourages optimism in financial markets—including crypto. Add to that the significant role Chinese traders and investors still play in the space, and you’ve got the perfect storm for a speculative surge.  # The Stars of the Show  This time, the spotlight is on a mix of well-established Chinese projects and newer, meme-worthy entrants. Let’s break it down:  * NEIRO (Neiro): The ""First Neiro On Ethereum"" meme coin about a Shiba dog, positioned as the sister of Doge. Its lighthearted branding and recent rumors of partnerships have made it an underground favorite, adding fuel to the fire. * **Conflux (CFX)**: Known as China’s public blockchain, it’s a top candidate for a Lunar New Year pump. Its ties to government-backed initiatives give it an edge. * **Neo**: Dubbed the “Chinese Ethereum,” Neo has been a household name in crypto for years. Expect renewed interest in its ecosystem this season. * **VeChain (VET)**: A long-time favorite for enterprise blockchain use cases, VeChain often sees activity spikes during speculative periods like these. * **QTUM, Ontology, and NULS**: These projects, though less talked about in recent years, remain on many watchlists for potential comebacks, especially given their ties to Chinese blockchain development.  # The Trump & Melania Effect  If that wasn’t enough, recent buzz around Trump and Melania-inspired crypto tokens has reinvigorated faith in high-risk, high-reward investments. Early adopters of those tokens saw massive returns, sparking FOMO among crypto traders. With the Chinese New Year around the corner, the sentiment is spreading to Chinese-linked assets, as traders hunt for the next big win.  This speculative enthusiasm ties into broader optimism about crypto adoption in 2025, as some traders see the festive season as an opportunity to kick off the year with significant gains.  # Will the Memes Deliver?  A unique part of this Lunar New Year speculation is the rise of meme coins tied to Chinese culture or narratives. These often move quickly, fueled by FOMO and trading volume, before cooling off just as fast. While the risks are high, the potential for short-term gains is undeniably enticing for many.  # What’s Next?  As the celebrations begin, keep a close eye on trading volume and price action across Chinese-linked projects. Whether it’s meme coins or established players like Neo and VeChain, the upcoming weeks could see explosive moves.  Remember, while speculation is fun, it’s always wise to invest cautiously. The Lunar New Year might bring pumps, but the crypto market remains as unpredictable as ever.  What do you think? Are we in for a massive Chinese crypto rally, or is this just another short-term hype cycle? Let us know your thoughts!

You throw some money in, not a ton but what you feel comfortable gambling. It goes up significantly and you wish you had thrown more at it, so you do. Maybe there are even a couple rounds of that and you grapple with the idea of pulling out some profits but you never do. Then the bottom drops out and it stings like hell.  The lesson to learn is to invest in it when people AREN'T going crazy over it. DCA in when things are low. Right now is the time to be DCA'ing out.  But you do you.",You should probably do more research before investing,"😂 read this and thought it asked if it was worth investing when coins are at ATL’s (all time lows) - which is also an interesting question. best time to add quality alts is deep into bear market.

It sure was easy as could be to give them money but when it comes to withdrawaling it, it simply won't give me the funds available.","For more in-depth skeptical discussion, we encourage our readers to use this [search listing](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=title%3A%22Monthly+Skeptics%22+author%3ACryptoSkeptics&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) for help finding the latest Skeptics Discussion thread.  ---   *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

CryptoCurrency,For the EIGHTH STRAIGHT YEAR: Announcing The Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment for 2025!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hvu3fn/for_the_eighth_straight_year_announcing_the_top/,1/7/2025,29,"https://preview.redd.it/ste610s7clbe1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1ee5bed78d2b78254f99cd2962945d2473e2976  # The 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrency Index Fund Experiment Has Begun!  For the [**eighth year in a row**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/), I am happy to announce the launch of the Top Ten Cryptocurrency Index Fund Experiment for 2025.    For those unfamiliar with the Experiments, my annual tradition is to buy $100 of each of the Top Ten Cryptos every New Year’s Day since [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).    ***The Top Ten Experiments have now purchased a total of $8,000 in crypto since January 2018.***  The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio includes the following cryptos, in descending order as per [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) on January 1st, 2025:  https://preview.redd.it/zex7wo5cclbe1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=4818de85bafc0aff776f36ff8f3df0ee075989de  **That’s a $1000 investment on the 1st of January, 2025**, ($100 each) of #1 **BTC**, #2 **ETH**, #3 **XRP**, #5 **BNB**, #6 **SOL**, #7 **DOGE**, #8 **USDC**, #9 **ADA**, #10 **TRON**, and #11 **AVAX**.  Fun fact #1: *For the second year in a row, all 2025 coins have appeared in at least one past Top Ten Portfolio, meaning no new cryptocurrencies have joined the overall Experiment.*   Long time Top Ten Experiment followers will notice **I’m again breaking the tradition of strictly investing in the Top Ten by market cap, no matter what.**  To stay consistent with past Experiments, I will only include one stablecoin, so #11 **AVAX** is in and #7 **USDT** is out.  I made a similar decision with the [**2022**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/), [**2023**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023/), and [**2024 Top Ten Portfolios**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024/).    **USDC** will remain in the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio.   So: ***The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio = Top Ten – USDT + #11 AVAX.***  Q: *Why keep a stablecoin in the portfolio at all?*   A: Consistency.  For better or worse, I included **USDT** in the [2019 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/) and one stable in every subsequent year since.  Including a stablecoin in the 2025 Top Ten is my attempt at an honest/fair comparison between each year’s portfolios.  Q: *Why were stablecoins included in the Top Ten Experiments in the first place?*    A:  Check out the [FAQs](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/).  # Where Did You Purchase The 2025 Top Ten Crypto?

Crypto has rapidly progressed in recent years and now more and more options exist.  This year I’ll be comparing my homemade Top Ten Index to [Coinbase’s COIN50](https://www.coinbase.com/coin50), Coinbase’s benchmark crypto index, which offers “diversified exposure to 50 leading digital assets.”  Here’s the snapshot of what COIN50 was worth on 1 January 2025:  https://preview.redd.it/lpxn0y2wclbe1.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=264120ef3c9e74a0ae217fc463236474e9e6e690  **Here’s the question I’ll be tracking:** as the year goes by, ***will COIN50 outperform my homemade Top Ten Index Fund?***   # All Systems Go!  Like every year, I’m excited to launch the latest iteration of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment. If you’re new to the Experiments, welcome! If you’ve been following over the years, many thanks for sticking around.   The first monthly report for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio will drop in early February.  Other reports from the 2018-2024 Top Ten Portfolios will be released periodically over the course of the year.

Give these new listings 1-2 months to establish a bottom before buying.  Pay more attention to the 15 min and 1 hour charts and less attention to the 1 minute chart.  When you buy, don't use all your fiat all at once. Leave some for other opportunities if prices dip more or there's a larger crash. That way you can improve your cost basis.  Don't get burned on meme coins, if you're hearing about them on here for the first time it's probably too late.  Pay attention to distribution cycles, understand market cap analysis, and learn why most coins hit their all time high early on and never reach it again.","This is a friendly reminder that Kraken Support will never DM you first, ask for your username or password, or ask you to transfer funds.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,228 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,376 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,844 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,585 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,249 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,551 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,248 today * $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,012 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P:   **After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,095.**  That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+237%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:    https://preview.redd.it/6p7xnw7l2uqe1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=f88d5ef418252dc71fd1b057af8cbbf6d97a5021  # Conclusion:  To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long.

We’ve seen how much sway Elon has over the crypto market, particularly Doge. A single tweet or even a vague reference from him can send it soaring. Now that he seems to be more involved in political conversations and making moves that might increase his influence, could this trickle down to Dogecoin’s favor?  It’s also worth considering how his broader goals, like integrating crypto into X, might play a role. If his political involvement strengthens the platforms he owns, we could see Doge positioned as more than just a meme coin. It’s a long shot, but stranger things have happened in the crypto world.

Understanding that Dogecoin took off because of the memeability of DOGE, it seems like the cat version (while not as meme able), should have some for historic value? The first cat coin ever launched, the counter part to Dogecoin, all seem like strong narratives, especially in todays world of thousands of terrible meme coins being launched a day. History seems to be a constant in holding value, Dogecoin, CryptoPunks, EtherRocks, etc.   I can’t figure out why it only has a $10M market cap? Dogecoin has a market cap of $62B. A coin as old as Dogecoin, that is the cat counter part shouldn’t least have a 1/100 value, which is a 62x. To me, it seems reasonable to have at least 1/10 the value, which is then a x620.    Maybe there is something in the history which is why it never gained popularity?  I bought a small amount, as a collector of historic “first” tokens.

CryptoMarkets,"DOGE Shows Positive Signals, Expected to Rebound?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1dtfly0/doge_shows_positive_signals_expected_to_rebound/,7/2/2024,0,"[Dogecoin](https://www.nanovest.io/kripto/doge/) (DOGE), a popular meme-based cryptocurrency, has recently shown a significant buy signal according to analysis by a pseudonymous analyst named Ali, using the TD (Tom Demark) Sequential indicator.  In his analysis, Ali suggests that the price of DOGE is expected to rebound in the near future. The TD Sequential indicator is a technical analysis tool designed to identify potential trend reversals. It was developed by Tom DeMark in 1994 and consists of two main components: setup (momentum) with nine candles and countdown (trend exhaustion) with 13 candles. This indicator signals potential trend reversals when the countdown reaches certain levels, following the setup phase.  Despite facing volatility and bearish sentiment, DOGE seems to be giving a strong buy signal based on this technical indicator. Ali believes that DOGE could see a price increase soon due to the signals generated by the TD Sequential indicator, which has issued a buy signal on the three-day chart.  This signal suggests that a trend reversal may be imminent, potentially paving the way for DOGE to reach higher price levels, including the critical level of $0.15. The three-day chart for DOGE also indicates a prolonged period of downward movement, marked by a series of red candles from mid-June to the end of the month.  Although DOGE experienced a decline from around $0.17 to just below $0.13, the appearance of a green arrow on the chart—indicating a TD Sequential buy signal—suggests a possible reversal.  Buy signals typically indicate potential upward movement over one to four candles, each representing a three-day period. Currently, DOGE has been in a bearish trend since June 7th, characterized by consistent red candles indicating sustained selling pressure. Around June 24th, DOGE found temporary support near the $0.12 level.  Based on the analysis charted above, the primary hurdle for DOGE is breaking above immediate resistance at $0.13. If DOGE maintains its upward momentum, the next significant targets could be $0.15 and potentially $0.17, where the initial downward trend began in early June.  This buy signal provides hope for DOGE investors that the cryptocurrency may soon recover and achieve higher price levels.  source: https://news.nanovest.io/berita/menunjukkan-sinyal-positif-doge-akan-rebound-9765/","Another useless AI predictive post.

CryptoMarkets,"Surely the only play is alts, catch the pump, sell before dump.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1l5jpcw/surely_the_only_play_is_alts_catch_the_pump_sell/,6/7/2025,51,"Hear me out. I think HODL is just for Bitcoin. Wait several years, keep DCAing, don't even check the price. Store of wealth and all that.  For those of us wanting to trade, I think alts are just oscillators. They have a base trend and very rarely (once per cycle, maybe even once per year) have a huge pump like this:  \- massive pump  \- decays away slowly  \- sometimes secondary pumps  \- but eventually reversion to the base trend.  Sometimes the base trend is slightly up (never good enough to HODL though), sometimes it's flat, sometimes it's down! But great long term appreciation, these aren't stocks!  Here are some opportunities:  **XRP**  Big pump every 3/4 years. It's slow rising long term but I would never hodl it instead of bitcoin. Today it's way too high, I don't believe it's established a new baseline, I don't care how close they are to the US government. It's heading back sub 1 again, just a matter of time. A terrible buy today. If you hold it today, just sell it. Literally no point owning it right now.  **ETH**  I think this is a long term slow grower, again with huge pumps every few years. Honestly, I think it's still a good buy. In fact, the recent pump signalled that there is still pump potential in ETH. Some alts pump twice and never pump again, I think ETH demonstrated it will still pump from time to time. It's such a high market cap that it's pumps aren't as violent as other coins but the pumps and the decaying dumps do take quite a while so timing is not difficult.  **SOL**  Looks way over-priced. Remember, these are not stocks. There are no discounted cash flows behind the scenes building up asset price like stocks. Alts can grow baseline over years but not hugely. I think SOL will eventually go back to sub-50. Terrible buy right now, you have no idea if it will pump big and beat ATH anytime in the next year or two, or dump to 50 first. Sell it now if you own it.  **DOGE**  I think this is a good buy again if you are willing to be patient and wait for the pump. When it pumps, it will double or even triple in price. How low could it go before then? It's 0.18 today, I can't see it going sub 0.10 and when it pumps it could go pretty high.  **LINK**  Almost at lows again, not a bad price, reminds me of DOGE.  **BCH**  Pumps are getting less each time but I still think it will pump higher if you bought today  **LTC**  This is overdue a huge pump I think. Even if it's dead and nothing happens, I don't think hard to exit break-even.  **DOT**  This is a bargain, I just wish it was easier to buy from DEX/swap services. Even if it only pumps to 10 again, that's more than 2x.     To reiterate, I think the only trading game is to try and buy at value prices, don't overpay. Wait for the pump, obviously try to time the top but even if you sell early you can make 2x easily and possibly more. Way better than BTC. I have BTC but I'm starting to think it's a waste of time, the risks don't justify the rewards. Whereas alts bought at low prices are very low risk.",I’m no longer interested in alts. Too many and over saturated fighting for retail money.   You’re not wrong. They pop off here and there. But I’m not about to get greedy with my investments any longer and hope and pray they move.   Bitcoin and some ETH and chill. It’s not worth the stress.,"Catch the pump, sell before dump? Oh damn, why didn't I think of that!",No ADA? Could go 2x easily when market condition start to loosen. Sure enough have good news happening. Last one pumped 100% in a fee hours. Clearly shows vitality and is on the target of whales.,"You need to look at BTC.D , ETH/BTC Ratio, compare the supply&marketcap from past and today on alts and also the price it was in the begin of the bullmarket to now.  eg.  BTC in Jan 2023: 16650$,  BTC in 2025 ATH: 110k $  \+660% raise.     Doge in 2023 at lowest: 0.05$  Doge ATH since: 0.47$  \+940%     That's are just 2 random examples.  Next I take for example LINK the comparisson between 6 June 2021 from snapshot in coinmarketcap and present.  2021:  Price: 27.55$  Marketcap: 11'874'992'855.91$  Circulating Supply: 431'009'554 LINK     Today:  Price: 14$  Marketcap: 9.22B  Circulating Supply: 657'099'970.45 Link (+52.45% more than in 2021).     Which means that if LINK have same marketcap as 2021, the value will not be 27$ but 18$, this due to the diluation of the new coins in circulation.  Marketcap 2021 / Circulating Supply Today = Price.     But all of these are also influenced by the value of the $, DXY.  If the dollar goes down, it's normal to see prices going up, it's just the devaluation of the $ but it's not a real gain.     There are so much data that people just don't look after but only dream of infinite pumps, like XRP at 100$ which it will be never a reality and these people are just delusional.",I am not putting my faith on alts this cycle even when I have a monstruous long at ETH.

Almost all of those ""partnerships"" were paid for by Ripple Labs to pilot them and almost all of them came back and said ""software is good, XRP is not.""

Elon Musk came out swinging against Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” calling it a “disgusting abomination” while Trump retaliated hard, threatening Tesla’s federal contracts and lashing out publicly.   At the same time, Bitcoin lost momentum and slipped below the $101K range, triggering widespread liquidations and shaking market confidence.

Could the breakdown between Trump and Musk reflect deeper cracks in the pro-crypto narrative?",This clash between Trump and Musk could signal a deeper fracture within the institutional support that has propped up crypto sentiment in recent months.

Bitcoin has hit 59k but price is struggling to hold so  It looks like bitcoin is going to hit below 54k or lower in the next coming weeks. The problem is the money flowing into bitcoin is from ETFs so alt coins missing out on their true potential.,Def not into ETH lmfao,"Yes. I think the real question is whether you should hang on to altcoins that have less intrinsic value but can be volatile in price compared to more ""stable"" like ETH and BTC. I would suggest that you convert only if you think that the long-term upward potential of more stable crypto is going to beat the growth potential of your altcoins.   **I understand your frustration because altcoins have been lagging ETH and BTC recently.** With the notable exception of coins like Solana, the rest of the altcoin market seems to be lagging.  I would suggest that, in terms of portfolio diversification, you convert some into BTC and ETH, and then the rest, you can try to convert it into riskier assets like meme coins. I know that sounds crazy but keep in mind that while the vast majority of meme coins go nowhere but down, there are some diamonds in the rough. These can make you quite a bit of money.  Here's the secret: Don't buy the meme coin when it launches. This is how most people play the meme coin game and **they get burned again and again because a lot of the time, the action is powered by bots**.   The better approach would be to wait until the market cap of the coin reaches a decent level, let's say $1 million to $10 million. In that window, start looking at the trading patterns of the meme coin.  If you notice a pattern where it would spike up, crash a little bit but never crash past the previous low point, and then spike up again and repeat this pattern in an upward pattern, you may be on to something.    Of course, you have to pay close attention to fundamentals, whether the liquidity pool is burned or if the contract is revoked. The usual shenanigans that developers might pull.   But as long as those fundamentals are clear and you see this pattern, that meme coin might be worth throwing some bucks into. Again, nothing is guaranteed. But meme coins with that pattern have a higher chance of yielding more money than the typical pump-and-crash pattern.  If you're sick of the volatility, you might want to consider ""safer"" crypto trading strategies. One particular method involves trading on the transactions instead of the long-term prospects of the coin.   This strategy is built on the fact that centralized exchanges have different valuations among them when it comes to crypto. These valuations are very small, but they exist nonetheless. These valuations happen in short periods of time.   What if you were able to buy crypto at an exchange where it's selling lower and quickly unload it on an exchange where it's selling higher? And if you do this in volume, those small gains can add up to a nice chunk of change. This is called ""crypto arbitrage.""   When done by individual crypto traders requires all sorts of fancy tracking software and of course memberships in a lot of centralized exchanges and liquidity pools. It can be a headache.   But there are centralized platforms for crypto leverage like ALO Finance that automate all of this. This way of trading crypto is so much safer than the typical meme coin and crypto trade strategy that some crypto leverage platforms will actually only charge you a fee if you make a profit.   Of course, do your own research. Pay careful attention to your risk appetite and plan ahead.",0.0,0.3094,0.0,0.9766,-0.7096,-0.431,0.9753,1.1207,20.1726

CryptoMarkets,What I think Trump will do next to the market,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1jz1vsv/what_i_think_trump_will_do_next_to_the_market/,4/14/2025,0,"This is my thesis and I would love you guys to give me feedback whether you think I'm right or wrong.  TLDR we can predict what Trump will do next with his tariffs by looking at what Elon did with DOGE  It feels like everything hinges on Trump and his tariffs now. So you can predict the market by predicting what he does next. I think Trump's narcissism is what dictates his behaviour. Whatever your political orientation, I don't think you can deny Trump is a profoundly egotistical person. Some people think that Trump enjoys chaos and drama. I think it's more accurate to say that he enjoys being the center of attention and having everybody react to him like he's the most important person in the world.  He's so arrogant he thinks he can actually do what he's claiming. Bring manufacturing back to the USA and make America self-sufficient in producing all the most important things from pharmaceuticals to semiconductors to electric cars etc. But he can't this is not realistic. This is like Elon Musk claiming that he can slash 2 trillion dollars from the federal budget. These people have delusions of grandeur. Trump literally said that he believes he was saved by God so that he can save America, so he actually thinks that he's going to be the savior of the USA. This means he's not going to settle for a small result with his tariffs. He makes such outlandish claims that people think he's not being literally serious but he is. Look at how he tried to hold on to power when he lost an election. The fact that he won this election when by all rights he should not have will have confirmed in his mind that he can actually bend reality, shape the world to his will. And he's going to take this mindset into the tariff negotiations with other countries.   Some people think that he's going to react reasonably and settle for a small win, for small concessions, from the countries that are trying to make a deal with him. And then he'll try to spin it to make it look like a big win, but I don't think he will. I think he actually will want these countries to bend over for him, to give in completely to him. WINNING, in his words. The fact that he did this 90-day pause wasn't because he saw reason and came to  his senses when he saw how the market was reacting. It was because the people around him pleaded with him. So he felt good feeling like he was being really generous and magnanimous by giving them what they wanted, like a king granting a royal pardon or something.  So I think he's going to enact more tariffs, do more extreme s***, to feel like he's saving America and changing the world, like the whole world is dancing to his tune and all eyes on him. When he opens up a newspaper or turns on the TV he needs to be the top main headline. So he's going to do more extreme stuff. In other words he's not going to act reasonably because he's not a reasonable or sensible person. He's a delusionally arrogant person. He's going to try to do with his tariffs what Elon did with DOGE, firing all those people and shutting down departments etc. That is the extreme level he's going to go to unless his advisors, the people around him, are going to be reasonable and sensible enough to talk him out of his most extreme whims.  The only caveat might be that the longer the situation drags on the more the markets may become desensitized to the tariffs fear. So if Trump announces more tariffs the market may not react as much because they might be desensitized to it now.  This is my hypothesis what do you guys think. Any and all feedback welcome. Love to get your opinions.","Smack it, flip it, bop it…",I bet even trump have no idea what is going to do next,And if you're correct the effect on crypto is....what?,"I think you're probably correct.  But I don't know what this means for crypto.  Nor do I know what the country can do about his behavior.    It seems like he wants to pull off an FDR level change over in the economy without the years it takes to do so.  He wants to reach the end game \*now\*.  FDR started from zero.  The economy had already crashed and he got to rebuild it the way he wanted.  He did major executive actions and stomped all over congress and the courts to do what he wanted.  It worked though and he's in the history books.    But Trump inherited a strong economy.  I guess he and Elon figured they had to break it all first.  But that means risking that they'll be on the wrong side of history.  Plus, none of us, (potentially even them), have any idea of the details of what they want to \*build\* (no concepts, we must have details).  Their ideas have never been vetted as really working the way they expect.  So they're testing changes in PROD so to speak.  It's been a helluva ride so far.    The countries they seem to be modeling do not have strong tech and science.  Hungary and Russia are seldom talked about in any circles that relate to technological progress.  Yet somehow, Trump/Vance/Elon etc. think they can shift the US economy to those models, shut down science research grants, enact tariffs, and we will have an explosion of tech companies come back to the US.  I'm mystified as are most folks.  Businesses are stalled, even if they weren't, it would take decades to move (only some of) the tech industries back to the US.

CryptoMarkets,Potential Altcoin Rally and Precautions,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1i344m7/potential_altcoin_rally_and_precautions/,1/17/2025,148,"What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin in the Upcoming Period? What Happened in the 2021 Altcoin Rally? How Long Will the Altcoin Rally Last and How Will It Unfold?  I will answer the questions of what we should do to not miss the altcoin rally, whether an altcoin rally is necessary, and more in detail.  First, let's examine what happened during the 2021 Bull Market and the Altcoin Rally, particularly in the last quarter of the Bull Market, and look at what occurred in Bitcoin Dominance:  In the 2021 Bull Market, the most enthusiastic phase of the altcoin rally started in the last quarter of the Bull Market, specifically in January 2021. At that time, Bitcoin dropped by 30% from $42,000 to $29,000, and Bitcoin dominance fell for 5 months, decreasing from 70% to 40%. After this drop to $29,000, Bitcoin rose by 2x from $29,000 to $65,000. However, altcoins, which had been lagging behind Bitcoin for a long time, surged 50x to 100x, marking their real rally.  Looking back at the 2021 Bull Market, from the March 2020 crash at $3,150 until January 2021, Bitcoin increased about 13 times, while altcoins were stagnant. When Bitcoin dominance reached its peak at 70% in January 2021, and dominance started to fall, Bitcoin only increased by 2x, while altcoins surged 50x to 100x.  Regarding Bitcoin dominance, it is inaccurate to say that ""once Bitcoin dominance reaches 70%, an altcoin rally begins."" Bitcoin dominance first hit 70% in July 2019, and it remained stuck between 70% and 60% until January 2021.  In the current period, most altcoins are down by 50% from their recent highs. Many altcoins completed their rallies before the 50% drop, and back in December 2023, when Bitcoin dominance was at 55%, people were already saying, ""Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance are at 55%, the altcoin rally is coming soon, let’s prepare our retirement portfolio."" I shared my thoughts on this back in December 2023.  Here is an excerpt from my December 2023 post:  ___  When Bitcoin dominance hit 70% in July 2019, we said, ""Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance are rising together, dominance may have peaked, and the altcoin rally will start soon."" We then added the top 10 altcoins of that time to our ""altcoin portfolio"" and awaited the drop in Bitcoin dominance to trigger the altcoin rally.  1- ETH: $363 buy, after crash $115, -68% loss   2- XRP: $0.31 buy, after crash $0.17, -45% loss   3- LTC: $145 buy, after crash $36, -75% loss   4- EOS: $8 buy, after crash $2, -75% loss   5- TRX: $0.04 buy, after crash $0.01, -70% loss   6- ADA: $0.1 buy, after crash $0.03, -70% loss   7- XLM: $0.12 buy, after crash $0.04, -70% loss   8- XMR: $121 buy, after crash $43, -64% loss   9- LEO: $2.1 buy, after crash $0.76, -64% loss   10- DASH: $190 buy, after crash $38, -80% loss    As you can see, our altcoin portfolio, made when Bitcoin dominance was at 70%, ended up with an average of -70% losses. If we had invested a significant amount into this portfolio without leaving any cash aside, during the long bear market of 1.5 years, our funds would have been severely eroded. As the market began to rise and we believed the bull market had started, many of us would have invested all our funds, only to see a 70% drop again. Our psychology would have been severely affected, family relationships strained, and our sleep disturbed. Some would have irrationally turned to gamble-like thinking, trying to recover their losses by putting all their remaining funds into the market, risking everything.  I believe there is a great deal of misinformation on Twitter regarding the interpretation of Bitcoin dominance, which has led many to be misdirected. I think that Bitcoin dominance may be approaching a peak around 55%. The altcoin rally in the final quarter of the next bull market could be triggered by Bitcoin dominance falling from 55% to 25%-30%. Personally, I believe this scenario will unfold during the final quarter of the next bull market. However, my main question is: how do we know for sure that Bitcoin dominance's rise will trigger the altcoin rally? We have seen such events before, but we cannot know with certainty when it will happen again.  Even now, when Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance are both rising, and altcoins are falling, people are prematurely declaring the bull market has definitely begun and the altcoin rally is imminent, which I believe is highly dangerous and misleading.  ___  Three months after my December 2023 post, most altcoins have experienced a 50% drop.  Back when Bitcoin was around $16,000-$17,000, I predicted that during the upcoming rise, Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance would rise together, meaning altcoins would see relatively less profit and that altcoins would likely see losses against Bitcoin. I switched to Bitcoin, and when Bitcoin dominance hit the 50%-58% range, I began shifting back into altcoins and transparently shared my altcoin portfolio.  Looking ahead, if the 2019 intermediate rally had unfolded differently, we would have expected a 50% drop in Bitcoin and a 70% drop in altcoins before the peak was reached. Initially, I thought we might see a drop from $42,000 to $29,000, but I was wrong. Now, Bitcoin has surpassed the previous peak of $65,000 without experiencing a similar crash, but most altcoins have completed their intermediate rally and are in the decline phase.  As for Bitcoin dominance, it first reached 70% in July 2019, and after a 530-day squeeze between 70% and 60%, it eventually fell to 40%, followed by a 4-month altcoin rally. Today, Bitcoin dominance has been stuck between 50% and 55% for around 200 days. A decline from this level could trigger an altcoin rally lasting about 4 months.  My personal view is that the bull market will follow the pattern of previous cycles, with the most likely peak happening between April and May 2025.  This suggests that after the summer of 2024, we should expect the rise to begin, and the altcoin rally could start by the end of 2024. However, if we experience an unprecedentedly long bull market, it could extend until the end of 2025. This is also a possibility, and if this happens, our expectations will be delayed by 6-7 months. Given the uncertainty, we should remain cautious, avoid margin trading, and focus on spot trading to protect ourselves from any unexpected crashes.  Looking at the altcoin rally in 2021, examining the coins that performed well, such as Hot, Chz, Avax, Solana, Band, Wrx, Matic, Sand, and Doge, we can analyze how the upcoming altcoin rally may unfold.  In my posts, I typically mention that the altcoin rally in the final 4 months of a bull market will occur in 3 phases. Let’s take a closer look at these phases.  **Phase 1: ""Excluding Old Investors""**  After a few months of modest gains, we will witness a sharp 70%-100% increase in altcoins in a single day. This will be followed by a 50% drop. During this phase, most people will begin selling their assets, and many will fall into the dangerous mindset of ""I sold at the peak, I will never buy again."" This will cause many to miss out on the true altcoin rally.  **Phase 2: ""Big Regret""**  After the 50% drop, a short-term zig-zag pattern will unfold, lasting around 30 days, with significant gains and losses. This phase will be psychologically exhausting for many investors, as they experience the emotional rollercoaster of regret for missing out on the earlier rally.  **Phase 3: ""The Swamp""**  The final phase, which typically lasts 2 weeks, is when altcoins will see an explosive rise of 100%-500% within a short period. This phase is crucial, as it marks the transition from euphoric gains to the beginning of the bear market, with altcoins dropping by 75% from their peak.  ---  **Final Thoughts:**  The crypto market is highly volatile, and no one can predict with certainty what will happen next. However, based on historical patterns, I strongly believe that an altcoin rally, similar to what we saw in the 2021 bull market, is inevitable. The influx of new investors into the market is driven by altcoins, and their spectacular rises act as advertisements to draw in new money.  While participating in this market, it’s essential to avoid the ""I’ve solved this market"" mentality. The most dangerous psychological trap in crypto is overconfidence, which leads many investors to make irrational decisions, and often lose everything.  Ultimately, it is crucial to recognize that in crypto, you are more likely to be the prey than the predator. Properly managing your risk, setting clear goals, and understanding the potential pitfalls can help you navigate this market more successfully.  Be cautious and remain aware of the risks.   ---  I hope this translation helps! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.",I never read long posts like this and I took a chance and really appreciate this breakdown.  Stay safe guys,"My thing is though, is the 2021 rally a good case study? That was during the pandemic. It was atypical. People were at home spending free money.","So what you're saying is, it could go up or down?","TL;DR: Potential Altcoin Rally and Precautions  2021 Altcoin Rally Review:  Altcoins saw explosive gains (50x-100x) only after Bitcoin peaked and its dominance fell from 70% to 40%.  Bitcoin’s rise (13x from March 2020 to January 2021) preceded the altcoin rally, during which altcoins underperformed until dominance dropped.   Current Market Dynamics:  Bitcoin dominance (currently 50%-55%) has been stagnant for ~200 days. Historically, a fall in dominance to 25%-30% triggers altcoin rallies lasting ~4 months.  Most altcoins are down ~50% from recent highs; many completed their intermediate rallies and are now in decline.   Historical Patterns:  In the 2019 rally, Bitcoin dominance peaked at 70% before falling and triggering a rally. Today’s pattern suggests Bitcoin dominance may peak at 55%, potentially sparking an altcoin rally by late 2024 or early 2025.   Phases of an Altcoin Rally:  1. Excluding Old Investors: Initial sharp 70%-100% gains followed by a 50% drop—many investors sell out prematurely.   2. Big Regret: A zigzag phase lasting ~30 days, exhausting investors emotionally.   3. The Swamp: Final euphoric 100%-500% rise within weeks, followed by a bear market where altcoins lose ~75% from their peak.    Market Outlook:  Most likely bull market peak: April-May 2025.  Possible altcoin rally by late 2024 if Bitcoin dominance declines.  Extended bull market (end of 2025) is possible, but caution is advised.   Precautions:  Avoid overconfidence; crypto is volatile and unpredictable.  Stick to spot trading, manage risks, and be ready for sharp corrections.  Learn from past cycles to avoid emotional and financial pitfalls.    Key Takeaway: Historical patterns indicate a significant altcoin rally is likely in the final months of the bull market. However, timing is uncertain, and proper risk management is essential to avoid severe losses.","Let me ask you this as I'm curious, do you see BTC dropping heavily when we get into bear market?

There are plenty of memecoins that have a use case 2. Most coins that you think have use case are worse than memecoins  ETH will not be the Blockchain of the future. ETH printed 70 million Ethereum tokens before they allowed anyone else to get in. They have used this money over the years to pay influencers to say ETH is great. It's not. If it was we would all be using it. ETH had 100% of the smart contract market but every time people use it the fees go up.   XRP is the scammiest token ever. They also enriched themselves with a bunch of tokens. They used these tokens to pay for influencers but these influencers are guys in suits so to the anon like you it seems more believable. Banks will never use XRP. Ever. But they will accept money to say they use XRP. I really like XRP army because they are really supportive. But their leaders (like politicians) can't be trusted.   SOL is run by criminals. Sam Bankman started Solana. That's all you need to know.   ADA has the slowest chain and nobody's building on it. When ever they actually launch something it takes 2 days to swap. Charles Hoskinson wrote a white paper and he got paid. He used to work with Vitalik and they couldn't get along. Ethereum had the ""brightest minds"" and they couldn't get it to work.   AVAX has a chance to be the ""next"" chain. It's founder Emin Gun Sirer found a flaw in ETH that caused them to do a hard fork. The thing they call ETH now is not the original Ethereum. (That's called Ethereum classic) AVAX believes no one chain can do everything. So they built a system that allows you to launch your own chain. The problem with AVAX is it's a bunch of boomers running it. It's very stuffy. When a new token is launched you have to be preselected to buy it. The same people over and over get selected which creates a strain on the community. It feels oppressive.   Hbar is corporate America on the Blockchain. None of the companies in the order uses the token.   Jasmy is a scam.   I could go on and on.  Buy Bitcoin. And if you're willing to get in the trenches find tiny projects under 100 million market cap that are building useful things. That's how you make real money.",What memecoins have a use case surpassing alt coins? I’m curious,"let’s be real…Bitcoin isn’t a functional storefront currency, and pretending it is doesn’t help anyone. It’s a great store of value, but it lacks speed, scalability, and real-world usability for transactions compared to other blockchains. It’s outdated, like using an old flip phone when the world had moved onto smart phones.   ETH has its flaws, but dismissing it entirely ignores the fact that it still dominates smart contracts, DeFi, and NFTs. High fees? Sure, but Layer 2 solutions are actively solving that.  Calling XRP a scam is just lazy & ignorant. Banks and financial institutions actively use it for cross border transactions. Just because you don’t like it doesn’t mean it’s not working. There’s a reason it’s known as the bankers token.   The bottom line is…dismissing everything but Bitcoin limits your view of what’s actually happening in crypto.

Outside of speculation based on quotes by XRP team, speculators, and rumors, SBI Holdings in Japan is the only ""huge"" institutional interest that has expressed and documented proof of adoption. That adoption was in the form of testing (alongside LINK, AAVE and others). This was revealed in a 169 slide powerpoint document from a 2017 information meeting. XRP was mentioned in ~3 slides.  The other bullish news (that still gets posted weekly on Reddit) is a quote by the SBI CEO from 2019 where he said, ""80% of Japanese banks will be using XRP by 2025."" Not even close to that yet, and of the banks that have been rumored to have adopted it or were confirmed to be testing it back in 2017, its not clear that they're still doing so.   LINK seems to be quite favored by institutions, and LTC is almost certainly getting an ETF and is already one of the three tradeable cryptos on Fidelity.   SUI decouples from the broader crypto market frequently and is a pretty solid (theoretical) alternative to SOL with slightly less shitcoins and a few attempts at ""utility"" coins launched on their ecosystem. Excellent for reliably swing trading too. Any time you're holding SUI you can swap your SUI for DEEP on the SUI ecosystem and see twice to triple the gains SUI itself does.

I think they created funnels to extract money. So we see the price drop when musk tweets to buy solana even when transactions are high. They can see sell orders as well and can beat them buy .0001 percent before yours gets triggered. So they skim. And poeple who do well with crypto understand they are playing the system and the people not the value.    That being said with bitcoin going down it’s safe to say that the algos are afoot.    My theories:  They are baiting buys to increase the money supply.    They are getting liquid for some reason.  As I try to game the game, I wonder why they would be getting liquid. It could be that the big whales are going to pump somewhere. Or that they need the money for other buys in this down economy (which makes a lot of sense)     This is the time to strike.

Rapidly growing community.** Pepecoin ($PEP) has been making waves, recently experiencing a **halving** with another one coming in just **1 month**. It’s up 20\*\*% today, and 24564% in 90 days,\*\* with a current market cap of **97M USD**. New listings include **Viabtc, F2pool, Antpool, Dxpool, EMCD**, **BinancePool and Coinex.com**– with more exchanges on the way.  Links:  * **Website:** [Pepecoin.org](https://pepecoin.org/) * **Github**: [github.com/pepecoinppc/pepecoin](https://github.com/pepecoinppc/pepecoin) * **Currency Symbol:** ₱ * **Algorithm: Scrypt** * **Merge Minable: Yes (AuxPow started at block 100,000)** * **Coinmarketcap:** [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepecoin-org/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepecoin-org/) * **Coingecko:** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepecoin-network](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepecoin-network)  # So, what’s Pepecoin ($PEP) All About?  Pepecoin is a **layer 1 blockchain** – not just another token. It’s built directly from **Dogecoin**, which means:  • It benefits from **Dogecoin’s active development**.   • It supports **merged mining**, so it can use the massive hash rate from **Litecoin** and **Dogecoin** to stay secure.  The goal? Bring together Pepe fans and Dogecoin lovers into one community, powered by a proper decentralized blockchain.  # Why was Pepecoin created?  Let’s be honest – people have wanted a **Pepe-themed crypto** for a long time. Last year, a bunch of Pepe-based **ERC-20 tokens** popped up, but they came with serious problems:  • **Too centralized**: Smart contracts give developers too much control.   • **Shady moves by developers**: Wallets worth tens of millions at the peak of their value were blacklisted and trillions of coins (created for the developers themselves) were dumped, causing a price crash. The contract was only revoked *after* taking advantage of the investors.   • **High fees**: Ethereum gas fees are still extremely high.  In short, all of the above had people both disappointed and fed up. Pepecoin was built to fix this. No smart contracts, no shady business – just a **real blockchain for the people**.  # Mining Rewards  |Block Range|Reward in Pepecoin| |:-|:-| || ||| |1-99,999|500,000| |100,000-199,999|250,000| |200,000-299,999|125,000| |300,000-399,999|62,500| |400,000-499,999|31,250| |500,000-599,999|15,625| |600,000+|10,000|  # Inflation Rate  Pepecoin follows the same emission model as Dogecoin, meaning it’s **inflationary** but encourages people to actually use it. After the **600,000th block**, about **5.256 billion coins** will be added each year. But as the supply grows, the annual addition becomes less significant – so the inflation rate drops over time.  # $PEP - Official Communities  • **Reddit**: [r/Pepecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecoin)   • **Discord**: [pepecoin.org/discord](https://pepecoin.org/discord)  Pepecoin tipping works across **all of Reddit** and on **34,000+ Discord servers** via [tip.cc](https://tip.cc/).

I want mine to be short and to go to the essential, I hope you will find some insights in it !  For years since it exists I have heard about bitcoin, but for some unknown reasons, I never went for it or serched for what it was until the beginning of this year. During all those years I only had mainstream biaised opinions and point of view but had no clue what it really was.  Then a friend who was into it send me a tv documentary about it that was really awesome. It resonated so deeply inside of me that I put my finger into the rabbit hole, then my whole being… The amount of passion I felt inside was imense.  With the documentary, I had the theory, the history, the philosophy, the technical aspects. From there I went fast into the practice and experience. I opened my first wallet and did my first transaction from fiat to bitcoin.  When I also went for my first centralized exchange, I discovered the whole world of altcoins that existed beyond bitcoin. I begun my first researches on the charts, using my intuition. Even if I felt things and I had some global understanding, my lack of knowledge and experience was total.  I was so passionate that I studied. A lot. I searched and I searched, had some deep understandings, becoming better. I didn’t felt very aligned with a lot of youtubers and so called experts. But I found two guys who I started to like. One was very conservative, patient, focus, alt tech oriented. Second one was a bit more degen in a disciplined way. I went some time with this yin and yang teachers.  On the degen side of the coin, I joined my first community in the teacher discord channel. Until that, I was very alone. Then I started to have some interaction with people in this crypto space I was so pationate about. I also started to discover the world of memecoin.  At that time the tech altcoins charts was so boring and depressive, even if I knew it was temporary, that the memecoin world was refreshing… Along with dangerous ! I discoverd by experience what scam, rugpull, honeypot, jeets, paper hands were…  I was disapointed, because I was feeling an imense potential in memecoins but it was screwed up by lies and complete misunderstandings by people. I learnt about myself that I didn’t want to trade all day long, watching the chart constantly, rotating, scalping, sniping, involving myself into shitty concepts and artwork… I wanted to trust into something. I understood that the token and the chart were belonging to people and with strong people to drive this, everything could change on a lot of plans. I wanted to belong, to work, to be part of something big.  I was lucky enough to find a memecoin that fitted all my feelings. I will talk to you about it by explaining my most conviction tokens after. I integrated the telegram and started to interact. There I watched what was real diamond hands, community take over, organic growth, legitimity, conviction, everlasting narrative, moral values and hard work. I felt like home. I started to invest myself a lot on it. I rotated a lot of my tech altcoins into this conviction memecoin. I didn’t knew yet that I was  just following the flow of this current memecoin super cycle that is happening now.  The post you’re reading is part of the work I’m doing for communities. I love to write, and when I saw that communities were lacking presence on reddit, I took this place. That’s how community works. You fill the space with what you are able to do and which is lacking. My first goal was to publish on a subreddit which required a lot of post karma. So I wrote a lot of posts, without using AI, without cheating with karma farming groups, and eventualy got all the karma I needed ! What a journey, I learnt a lot.  An other decisive step into my crypto experience was the video of the guy called MustStopMurad. I give you the link because this is the most importe video you have to watch right now for your overall wealth and world understandings :  [https://x.com/muststopmurad/status/1839732601759641960?s=46&t=6e7XaEO6M77um3MXJx3v5w](https://x.com/muststopmurad/status/1839732601759641960?s=46&t=6e7XaEO6M77um3MXJx3v5w)  How did this guy put in words everything I was thinking ?  In this video, he’s explaining why the system of the altcoins is completly broken, because the most important things is happening during private rounds. Retail are just exit liquidity. That the real product of the altcoin, is the token itself. Not the technology. Both altcoins and memecoins rely to speculation and memecoins are just better at that because of the communty working relentlessly and the narrative. Memecoins have much more utility than so called utility tokens by providing fun, belonging, friendship, sense of participation, mission, meaning, artistic expression, charity, etc. Memecoins are a tokenized community. Beyond the 99.9% of memecoins that are PvP hypergambling tokens and that are not relevant, it exists PvE memecoins that are cults, world movements and emerging minireligions. That’s the ones that are importants that I will share with you.  And one quote I want to remember for a long time : STOP TRADING AND BELIEVE IN SOMETHING.  All those things resonated deeply within me. I feel it more and more. I belive that’s where the biggest gains will be made, financially but for the whole being also. Find one of these trustful communities wich resonate with you, grab a bag, and hold it !  Here are overall guidelines to seek when searching for the next big memecoins :  -        Buy memecoins that can become very big  -        Buy memecoins that have undergone multiple – 70%  -        Study coins that spent a long time under <$10M  -        Study coins that have people hustling for free  -        Use BubbleMaps and HolderScan to check Distribution  Now I will share with you the pure gems I found with a lot of researches. They are checking a lot of boxes. This is not financial advice. I just want you to do your researches on these. They are very special. I have full trust and conviction on them, I think they are worldwide movements with infinite potential, that they are worth our time, energy and money.  $SAITAMA ON ETH – LOW CAP  [https://x.com/SaitamaInuERC20](https://x.com/SaitamaInuERC20)  This coin is a legendary one. It reached $7B market cap last cycle and was the only challenger of Shiba Inu. Unfortunately, the old devs ruined everything by rug pulling. Things are not over. Now they are headed to jail. And a community took over with the same OG Saitama whales that pushed it the first time, without the devs. This narrative is amazing, it talks about justice, about empowering ordinary people. We know by history that this can reach the summits. The community is running for a while now and is working relentlessly to do right the wrong things that have been done in the past, to restore its glory and get it back to billions again ! I repeat, this coin is now running on a new contract and has nothing to do with the old devs.  $SATOSHI NAKAMOTO – LOW CAP  [https://satoshitoken.org/](https://satoshitoken.org/)  $Satoshi is the token that represents all of crypto. It unites us all. This narrative will only gets more relevant and significant overtime. It’s the closest relative Memecoin to Bitcoin. The community is a pure talent, the token is cross chains, there are major innovations regarding NFT’s. I don’t know why this is still so cheap, I’m glad I found it cause there is no way this token will not go to billions.   $Satoshi is a second chance to take the equivalent of Bitcoin at its early stage. This is the legacy token we are all searching for. It is very simple but there are a lot of things to say. Check this link for all the informations you need about this token :   [THE SATOSHI EVOLUTION.

You know about Doge, about Shiba Inu. But most of them are shitcoins and will die tho. Only a few will survive and $Oscar is one of them. Oscar is the first meme that was the catalyst for the moonshot rise of SHIBA INU. Now $Osacar as its own coin, and among the community there is Paradox, the Co-founder of Shiba Inu and designer of its logo. $Oscar seems to be adopted, people don’t sell wich is very important. The community is hard working with like I said OG Shiba Inu very experienced members. I think it is still very early for this one !     $SPX S&P6900 – HIGH CAP  [https://spx6900.com](https://spx6900.com/)  You really should go on the website. You’ll have the laugh of you day ! Beyond the fun of this project, there is a bluechip memecoin. It’s really cult. This is a multicycle Memecoin. I think in the world we are living, the rational part, the left brain, has taken the major part. This token is about irrational, about pure creativity, to restore the glory of the right part of the brain that have been set apart and that want to take revenge. Both part of the Brain have the same size, this token is a major overall contribution to restore the balance. The chart is making people to realize this, and it is far from over.     I hope all of this was insightful.

I’m talking when they are worth 0.00000000001. Do you have to be plugged into some crypto social network to get first dibs on these coins?  Also Coinbase, Robinhood and other mainstream trading apps usually never have access to these coins at such early stages anyway and by the time they introduce them you’ve already missed that first initial pump.   Like will there ever be another Doge coin or SHIBA INU coin?    Curious to know how this all works..","The simple answer is you don't unless you are part of the pump and dump scam insiders.  If you try you likely will just get fleeced by pump and dump scammers.  If you are adamant about trying to catch a rising baby shitcoin then you need to know how DEX like uniwap and Jupiter work, have a non-custodial wallet already loaded with some tradable assets (SOL, USDC, or USDT).

We all know blockchain has many uses but many of those uses have not yet come to fruition. Yet inflation is rampant.  Many research reports have studied the rampant rise of memecoins. The psychology behind it is quite intriguing. Many of todays youths feel trapped in this endless cycle of inflation. Never being able to own a home due to lack of opportunities. Some may consider it a less risky way of gambling, while others see it as a slightly riskier investment than stocks with a quite possibly way larger return on investment.  Have you heard of the guy that invested 28$ in PEPE and sold for 55m. That's crazy. You'll never see those kinds of returns in the stock market in such a short time without crazy derivatives or margin. Small Cap Stocks are primed to fail as well thanks to Naked Shorting and hedge funds.  In my opinion, doing your research on ""memecoins"" can be a smarter investment with a little amount of money rather than investing in small cap stocks or large cap stocks and waiting for 30 years. The secret to the memecoins, is obviously the contract, the dev/team and the community. If all 3 of those pieces are in place then you are golden.

CryptoMarkets,Meme Coin Story Time…. Newcomers MUST READ THIS.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1iy0dui/meme_coin_story_time_newcomers_must_read_this/,2/25/2025,7,"I have been an investor in the space since 2019, and through just these 6 short years here, I have seen a lot. I don’t know for sure (maybe someone can chime in), but I don’t we even think we had “Meme Coins” until Dogecoin. I remember buying DOGE at $0.006 for shits and giggles because my son likes Dogs. I was like, “I’ll build a modest portfolio that I can gift to him when I die.”  I never imagined the run that Meme Coins would go on…..  Now, being in the space for awhile, I know (of) a handful of whales. I know of a couple people that are Meme Coin Whales as well. One of them has hit it BIG on several coins. I saw him turn $10k into $100k+, a few times. One coin he hit over $300k on.   He portrays himself on Social Media as a guru. Someone who knows something you don’t. Kind of like an Influencer, Because people actually watch his Socials to get cues since they know he picks winners. Myself included (except I don’t buy Memes anymore). He shows all kinds of TA too, looks legit. *Wow, this guy really Does his research.*  However, his strategy is a very simple method called: ***”Pump & Dump.”***  He is apart of a group, with hundreds of other Whales. Big Whales too. Guys with Millions. And influencers, some are minor celebs too.  They go *”TrumpCumsInElon Coin at Friday 12 noon.”*  This means on Friday at 12 noon, they are going to start “Pumping” the price. You see, with the Micro Caps, it’s very easy to pump the price with very little Liquidity. Then they jump on their Socials and tell all of their Fans and Friends about it. *”This one’s gonna be BIG, don’t miss out!!”* People jump on to see the coin running, and they FOMO in at the Top.   ***What you don’t know, is that this Group already bought up all of the Supply. They are the ones Selling it to you.*** As FOMO kicks in, they continue to sell until Buying pressure ends, then they start “Dumping”, or as many people like to call it “Rugging”.  This is literally what’s happening right now on a Daily Basis. If you are buying Meme Coins, you are just some Whale’s Exit Liquidity. Period, point blank. Only people who get in and out during the initial pump make money, everyone else is left Holding the bag. *Sound Familiar?*  Look, I am just trying to give you all the heads up what’s going on. Because I see a TON of posts like *”I lost all my Money in Memes.”* Yes, of course you did because that’s what they are designed to do. You won’t make money there, and the faster you realize this the better off you will be in this game.  Also, I want to point out that this group has done this for YEARS. With MANY coins that you have heard of. You heard of SHIBA??? Yes, that one. They pumped it so hard in 2021 that it ended up becoming a Top 100 coin based on all of the Bag holders. Really amazing to be honest.   Listen to this Post, it’s probably not what you want to hear but it’s the truth. I hope you All Make it in 2025.","Agreed, that’s why I stopped trading memes. It’s just gambling if you’re not an insider. Just spot and maybe leverage on btc, sol, eth is the way.",What if we just buy when it initially launches and sell after a short profit? Me belonging to a 3rd world country getting a 10$ profit on a trade is a really good amount. And I heard about a meme coin getting launch for Kanye West? Shouldn't it be promising if I can buy at the start and sell it in 10-15 minutes or maybe in an hour once it 2x-4x the initial amount put in it?

CryptoMarkets,"A Clear Perspective on Spot Investments in Bitcoin and Altcoins, and Investor Psychology in Market Cycles",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1icsxbw/a_clear_perspective_on_spot_investments_in/,1/29/2025,20,"The market cycle and investor psychology give us a transparent and clear understanding of where we stand in Bitcoin and altcoin spot investments.    During the 2017 bull season, after altcoins had surged 50x to 100x, most investors firmly believed in the crypto sector’s immense potential and saw no reason for a market drop. They patiently held onto their investments.    At the beginning of the 2018 bear season, every dip was perceived as a buying opportunity. Investors kept buying as prices fell further. Many justified holding onto losses of 40%–50% by saying, ""We're only losing from our profits; it will rise again, so we shouldn't sell now.""   However, during the early stages of the bear market, the cycle deceived even those who had sold at the right time by making them believe that it was a new buying opportunity, pulling them back into the swamp of losses.    By 2019, when Bitcoin hit its bear market bottom at $3,150, many altcoins were delisted from exchanges and vanished entirely. The remaining ones had plummeted by up to 95%, turning most investors' funds into dust.    Similarly, during Bitcoin's drop to $15,500 in 2022, people started waiting for $9,000, just as they had previously expected a return to the 2013 bull peak of $1,200.    During the 2019 bear market, spot investors were seen as fools. The most popular argument at the time was:    ""With leveraged trading now available, we will never again see 50x-100x gains on altcoins like in 2017. We will never experience another altcoin rally.""  However, the 2021 bull market completely disproved this argument, with tokens like MATIC, LINK, HOT, WRX, and CHZ surging 100x, and LEND, FTM, DOGE reaching 1,000x gains.     The Psychological Setup Before an Altcoin Rally    During the 2019 bear market relief rally, Bitcoin climbed from $3,150 to $14,000, then dropped back to $6,000. At this point, altcoins lost all of their previous gains and even created new lows.    This set the perfect **psychological stage** for an altcoin rally.    By this time, the perception of spot investment had changed from being seen as dumb and naive to an understanding that trading was the only viable strategy. Even those who had believed in holding spot investments gave up and switched to short-term trades when their portfolios were down 70% during the relief rally's crash phase.    In August 2020, we experienced a mini altcoin relief rally similar to today's market cycle.    Bitcoin topped at $12,500, then corrected only 20% to $10,000 over three months. However, during this period, altcoins sharply dropped by 50%–70% despite Bitcoin’s relatively minor decline.    The 2024 market cycle resembles this period, but with a crucial difference:    - Normally, a longer correction phase results in shallower losses, while a shorter one leads to more drastic drops.   - However, we experienced both an extended correction phase and harsh 70%–80% drawdowns, marking a historical anomaly.    This prolonged downturn has now perfectly recreated** the psychological environment necessary before an altcoin rally.    The Emotional Shift Before the Next Major Bull Run    Throughout October 2023 – March 2024, we experienced a relief rally, and optimism was high.    During this period:    - Everyone held onto their investments, believing a bull run was imminent.   - Investors were happy and convinced altcoins would soon skyrocket.    However, as the altcoin market crashed by 70%–80% afterward, it successfully instilled the fear and disbelief necessary for an altcoin rally to begin.    In March 2024, when altcoins return to previous high levels, market sentiment will be drastically different:    - Instead of excitement, investors will fear another crash.   - Many will sell early out of paranoia, becoming day traders instead.   - As altcoins continue rising, former bagholders will think:     *""I sold here; I won’t buy again until prices drop to where I sold.""  - This psychology will make holding through gains the hardest it has ever been.    By the peak of the next bull run, long-term spot investors who endured the pain will celebrate victory, while short-term traders will be left with deep regrets.    New investors entering in 2025 will see that the biggest winners are long-term spot holders, convincing them to become long-term investors too—just in time for the next market collapse in 2026–2028.    My Personal Strategy    - When Bitcoin was $17,000, I predicted Bitcoin dominance would rise alongside BTC's price.   - I switched entirely to Bitcoin, expecting it to outperform altcoins.   - As Bitcoin hit $60,000 (a 4x gain), I converted everything into altcoins in May 2024.    At this point, I no longer trade. Instead, I patiently hold my portfolio until specific market conditions signal it’s time to sell:     My Selling Criteria:    1. DXY at 90 (Dollar weakening)   2. Bitcoin dominance at 40% (Money flowing into altcoins)   3. USDT dominance at 2%–3% (Retail speculation peaking)    I will sell everything at once unless some of my coins already surge 10x–20x before that point.    Even though altcoins may double or triple afterward, I won’t take the risk of getting caught in the next bear market. I will withdraw all my funds from exchanges to avoid temptation.    When I sell, I will publicly announce my exit, detailing:    - The potential upcoming bear season - How the bear market will unfold  - How our portfolios would shrink dramatically if we don’t exit in time   By that time, new investors will flood in, and the market will be euphoric. The news cycle will be overwhelmingly bullish, and people will believe there’s no reason for prices to drop—just as it always happens at the top.    However, my goal is not to engage in arguments but to warn people calmly and consistently—even if I receive backlash from newcomers.    I deeply appreciate everyone who took the time to read this detailed analysis. I hope it provides even a small amount of value in your journey.","Honestly at this point I don’t even know what’s going to happen.

What exactly do AI coins do, or are they just like buying shares into an AI project in a way?  I don't know if there are books to read. Most YouTube channels are purely talking about what the next big coin is, or what's going on in the market right now. Could do with a real 'Back to basics' approach, if someone can give me a push in the right direction I'd really appreciate it.  Example:  I couldn't tell you exactly what the differences between web2 and web3 are, just web3 is decentralised? Are all cryptos therefore web3? In what way?  Layer1, Layer2, Layer3 crypto?   I almost know what a blockchain is from a video I watched a while back.

Doge has been around for a while but it's still trending under $1 but dogwifhat was launch like a year ago and it's over $3? How is that possible? Is it just the market? Investors? How is it some are struggling to build up but others are just flying?   That's what I'm trying to understand.,Don’t look at price look at market cap,Definitely buy ICP. Google “fastest blockchain”. Spoilers: it’s icp.,"Dogecoin has a circulating supply of 147 billion tokens, WIF has 1 billion tokens.  Price does not matter in this case. A project with a trillion tokens will not easily be 1 dollar, as it would be worth 1 trillion in total. Same applies with Dogecoin.  However, when you look at the total value of all the coins combined (the market cap), you see which is the bigger coin.  Doge is currently at 62 billion dollars  WIF is currently at 3 billion dollars.  Therefore if WIF did a 20X today, it would still be worth less than Doge, even though the price per token would be $60.  This is the reason that many people with a higher risk tolerance invest in smaller cap coins. Higher risk, but higher reward.

CryptoMoonShots,"Doge, Neiro And Neirei",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1g7hhmh/doge_neiro_and_neirei/,10/19/2024,989,"While Dogecoin and Neiro are warming up, what about NeiRei?  Dogecoin is rising again with the rise of BTC.  After Kabosu died, the same family adopted a dog for the second time. This dog is Neiro. The dog that the Binance co-founder wrote an article about and referred to as the next Doge. The reason he referred to it as the next Doge is because it is the second dog that the Kabosu family adopted. Right now, everyone in crypto is referring to Neiro as the next doge and they even think that it will surpass Shiba in terms of market cap.  Dogecoin's ATH is 106B market cap. Neiro's ATH is 970m market cap. Now let's come to the headliner, headliners always go on stage last and NeiRei is quietly preparing to take the stage. It is still in the 3-4m market cap range. Its still very early.  With the bull run ahead of us, it wouldn't be surprising if Dogecoin reaches ATH again, and Neiro reaches the 10-20B market cap range. That's what I believe.  What about NeiRei?  I am a Neiro holder. I invested in Neiro early on and now I have a big bag. An untouched bag.  While constantly chasing early opportunities on the road to freedom, sometimes some come to you by chance, sometimes you have to find them yourself, if you are reading this post, I guess you are in luck.  After Neiro took action, I immediately started looking for alternatives, Neiro was good but I needed to reach cumulative growth.. I had to take advantage of this hype.  And yes. I came across NeiRei. The developer had left the coin. And I saw that it was CTOed. The first thing that caught my attention was that it was CTOed. Because Neiro was CTOed and its alternatives should be CTOs too.  I started researching what alternative Chinese coins were doing. Pepe is not being talked about anywhere, I saw PeiPei, the Chinese version of Pepe, reach 180m ATH. I guess I was in the right place. Neiro will be talked about everywhere during the bull run and it is silently standing there: NeiRei. The Chinese Neiro.  NeiRei was CTOed by a few people who believed in it. Neiro is following its hype. Neiro is being talked about everywhere and all eyes should be on NeiRei.  Floor formed strongly in the 3-4m market cap range. The accumulation period continues. As the Neiro hype gets crazier, NeiRei will be next.  Considering that Neiro will reach 5-10b market cap, I see a very high probability of NeiRei reaching the 100-500m market cap range with the crazy bull run.  I focus on the things that have the potential to lead me to financial freedom and I have to tell you clearly that the 2 things that have the highest probability of doing so during this bull run are Neiro and NeiRei.  We may have missed Pepe and PeiPei, but Neiro and NeiRei were sent to us as a second chance. With even greater potential than Pepe and PeiPei.  Now I'm just telling you this and signing it:  Neiro and NeiRei will surpass all the coins before them and head straight to the top.  While you still have time. While you're still early.

Often overshadowed by the fame of Doge, Colon is actually the predecessor of all dog-themed memecoins. Colon's importance in the crypto world is undeniable, as it laid the foundation for all the beloved dog memecoins we see today, including the OG Shiba Inu, Floki, Bonk, Kishu, Neiro, and of course, Doge itself.  Without Colon, Doge might not have become the adorable and widely beloved meme that has dominated the crypto space.   In fact, Colon's significance was highlighted as early as 2009 in Atsuko Sato's blog, where she celebrated Colon as the original. For those unfamiliar, Atsuko Sato is Kabosu’s owner—the Shiba Inu who inspired the famous Doge meme. Sato's blog posts and tweets about Colon confirm his foundational role in the world of dog-themed memecoins.   ### Proof of Colon’s Legacy - Atsuko Sato’s Blog (2009): [Original Post](https://kabosu112.exblog.jp/9330818/) - Tweets by Sato:   - [Tweet 1](https://x.com/kabosumama/status/8658050709716993) | [Why Professor Colon looks different](https://kabosu112.exblog.jp/11627433/)   - [Tweet 2](https://x.com/kabosumama/status/8345300049596416) | [The Truth About Colon](https://kabosu112.exblog.jp/11623738/)  Atsuko Sato first introduced the world to $DOGE, sparking the first generation of dog-themed memecoins.

Originally launched in 2013, Luckycoin is the codebase that Dogecoin was forked from, making it a foundational piece of meme coin history. Unlike many modern coins, $LKY was fairly distributed from day one — with no premine, no ICO, and a hard-capped supply of just 20 million coins, giving it real scarcity.  After years of dormancy, the project has been revived, gaining traction with miners and early adopters alike. It’s now being actively mined via Binance Pool and BTC, and the network hashrate is at an all-time high, reflecting renewed interest and growing network strength.  Despite its historic roots and technical fundamentals, $LKY still sits at a tiny $8 million market cap — a fraction of what similar projects have reached. This is not just another meme coin chasing hype — this is the source. If you missed Dogecoin early, Luckycoin offers a second chance.  Launched in 2013 — Dogecoin was forked from its code  Fair launch — no premine, no ICO 20M max supply — true digital scarcity  Revived in 2025 — development and interest are back  Mined via Binance Pool and BTC — strong mining backing  ATH network hashrate — growing security and support  Only $8M market cap — major upside potential  Not a copy but the origin of meme coin culture  [Join the Luckycoin community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LuckycoinProject)","Be sure to do your own diligence.

Analysts watch. Traders speculate. And across the decentralized corners of the internet, one thing becomes clear: *DJI isn’t just watching history — it’s making it.*  Welcome to *DOGE JONES* — not your average memecoin, not another fleeting pump-and-dump, and definitely not a project built on empty promises. This is a *movement*, a phenomenon, and perhaps, the next great chapter in crypto history. While most tokens follow the market, *DJI leads it*. It’s where *memes meet momentum*, and *retail meets revolution*.  ---  *Born Different. Built Different.*  In a landscape overflowing with generic coins and short-lived hype, *DOGE JONES was built with intention* — backed by a *fierce community*, fueled by meme culture, and inspired by the legends of Wall Street. But this time, *Wall Street doesn’t wear a suit — it wears diamond hands*.  This isn’t about following trends. This is about *being the trend*. DJI doesn’t wait for permission. It doesn’t check in with traditional finance. It breaks molds, *challenges narratives*, and disrupts charts. Every green candle, every volume spike, every new wallet added to the ecosystem is *a testament to community-driven value creation.*  —  *More Than a Coin — It’s a Culture*DJI isn’t just another memecoin hoping to ride a temporary wave of attention. It’s *culture in motion*, *finance in rebellion*, and *internet humor weaponized for wealth creation*.  Let’s face it — the meme economy is no longer a joke. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and others have shown us what’s possible when memes meet mass adoption. But *DOGE JONES takes it a step further*. It’s not trying to copy past successes — it’s *creating a new benchmark* for what meme-backed assets can achieve.  In this world, *community is capital*. Memes are marketing. Momentum is everything.

CryptoMoonShots,It's Doge but with Giga Chad,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1hdkw58/its_doge_but_with_giga_chad/,12/13/2024,8,"The reason $DOGE and $PEPE were able to garner such large success is due to the virality effect. In order for a memecoin to generate success, it needs to be a meme that exists in of itself... that even your Uber driver would know.  On crypto twitter, people trade and chase the next shiny object. There is no longevity and the end goal is normies. Normies do not trade but rather hold their cryptocurrencies. At $GIGA, normies have been and continue to be onboarded since the inception of the token.  Internet usage skyrocketed in the early 2000's and companies quickly understood the importance of network effects. From this, social media was born from the ashes. With this rise of the internet, ""memes"" became commonplace. They were silly jokes and trends that people would share with their friends. One share would turn into 2 shares, then 4 shares and so on and suddenly a meme is ""viral"".  In this same way, having ""normies"" in early into a viral meme like Gigachad causes a similar network effect. One person excited about the cryptocurrency attracts 2 new normies, which attracts 4 more and so on.  With Gigachad being one of the few most viral memes of all time, the rise of the masculinity movement, and the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency - the timing has never been more perfect for a meme like Gigachad to take the world by storm.  Naturally, $GIGA attracts real, IRL, high-testosterone, chad holders. No soy jacks, no larps. $GIGA attracts people to hold and be apart of a movement of masculinity and improvement.  Low testosterone = prone to fear.  High testosterone = confidence/conviction.  $GIGA is a relevant IRL meme that normies are aware of. Real memes are the only real meme coins, the holders are all chads, and the Gigachad meme on solana is irreplaceable due to the community ownership of the u/gigachad twitter handle and being partnered with the original meme creator Ernest Khalimov and photographer Krista Sudmalis.","Be sure to do your own diligence.

His playful leap wasn’t just a moment of joy; it was the first bounce in what would become the legacy of $SHIB and now, complete with $OSCAR   When Ryoshi @RyoshiResearch on X laid the foundation for $SHIB, he paid tribute to this early meme in his All Hail The Shiba! article (August 2, 2020), unknowingly linking $OSCAR to the origins of one of crypto’s most iconic communities. But Oscar’s story doesn’t end there. With the unwavering support of the $SHIB community and Paradox Designer @ParadoxDesigner on X , Ryoshi’s closest collaborator and the creator of the $SHIB token logo, $OSCAR has returned, not just as a token, but as a symbol of the movement’s roots.  Like a dog joyfully chasing its own tail, crypto has a way of coming full circle. $OSCAR isn’t just about nostalgia, it’s about honoring the past while building the future. With a mission centered on joy, respect, charity, and keeping the spirit of Shiba Inu alive, $OSCAR invites the community to be part of something truly special, something woven into the very DNA of $SHIB ‘s origin.

CryptoMoonShots,I would like to take a few minutes of your time to introduce a layer 1 proof of work coin called DogeGPU.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1iaype0/i_would_like_to_take_a_few_minutes_of_your_time/,1/27/2025,20,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, speed, efficiency, and accessibility have become paramount. DogeGPU emerges as the official cryptocurrency of Mars. It surpasses both Bitcoin and Dogecoin by offering ultra-fast 15-second block times. While Bitcoin's antiquated 10-minute block times often lead to delayed transaction confirmations and network congestion, unusable episodes, DogeGPU accelerates transaction processing, enhancing network responsiveness and providing a seamless user experience. This significant reduction in block time means that DogeGPU processes transactions 4X faster than Dogecoin (which has a 1-minute block time) and up to 40x faster than Bitcoin, effectively addressing the scalability issues inherent in older blockchains. By merging the beloved community spirit of Dogecoin with advanced GPU-optimized mining algorithms, DogeGPU not only democratizes mining but also revolutionizes transaction speed and efficiency. It represents a new era of cryptocurrency where transactions are swift, mining is accessible, and the community thrives—all while leaving the competition in the ""dog"" house due to their sluggish performance. With DogeGPU, the future of digital currency is not just fast—it's instantaneous.  We have a fun laid back community, no drama, weekly trivia event using discord tipcc, and random drops through out the week. Feel free to ask questions!  Important Note: While it's exciting to see $dogpu gaining momentum, it's crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency world is full of surprises. There's no guarantee that $dogpu will continue to rise in value. Always do your research, be aware of the risks, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Keep your curiosity about crypto alive, and remember to stay informed and responsible!  Specs- Layer 1 POW with it's own blockchain.

CryptoMoonShots,MuskyDoge: The Low-Cap Crypto Bridging Gaming and Blockchain,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1i8crmb/muskydoge_the_lowcap_crypto_bridging_gaming_and/,1/23/2025,3,"MuskyDoge is a project that has been in development for years and remains largely undiscovered despite having a solid foundation. At a market cap of just $15,000, it presents a significant opportunity for early adopters. Unlike many speculative tokens that rely solely on hype, MuskyDoge has real-world application through its gaming ecosystem.  DMP4om35PFGVpmbs2TsGGBUDAUDCHFDhiodGVwZ8pump  The project previously reached an all-time high of $3 million, and that was before it had any substantial utility. Now, with a functional game generating revenue and a well-structured token model, the potential for growth is stronger than ever.  Gaming Revenue Driving Sustainable Growth  One of the standout aspects of MuskyDoge is its integration with gaming. The team has successfully launched Backyard Paintball, a mobile game available on both app stores that is already generating revenue. While the game includes pay-to-win mechanics, the key point is that profits are reinvested into the MuskyDoge ecosystem. This creates a self-sustaining cycle where revenue from gaming supports the token, rather than relying solely on speculation or marketing-driven price pumps.  Unlike many projects that launch with promises of future development, MuskyDoge has a working product that is already contributing to the ecosystem. This positions it as a serious player in the intersection of gaming and blockchain technology.  Tokenomics Built for Long-Term Viability  MuskyDoge has structured its tokenomics to support long-term growth. 	•	1.63% of the total supply has been burned, reducing overall circulation over time. 	•	No transaction taxes—every trade is tax-free, making it more attractive for traders and investors. 	•	A focus on real utility, rather than artificial scarcity or temporary hype cycles.  By keeping the system simple and transparent, MuskyDoge avoids many of the pitfalls seen in other small-cap tokens. There are no complex staking mechanisms or unnecessary taxes that can discourage trading activity. Instead, the focus remains on growing the ecosystem through actual revenue generation.  Beyond Just Another Token – A Clear Vision for the Future  Many low-cap crypto projects struggle because they lack a real purpose beyond speculation. MuskyDoge is different in that it is actively working to bridge the gap between gaming and blockchain technology. By building an ecosystem where a functioning game directly contributes to the sustainability of the token, the team is creating a model that is designed to last.  Unlike projects that rely solely on new buyers to keep prices stable, MuskyDoge benefits from an external revenue stream. As the game continues to grow in popularity, its profits can be used to further enhance the ecosystem, creating additional value for token holders.  Why Now? 	•	Extremely low market cap of $15,000 means early investors have significant upside potential. 	•	Gaming integration provides a real-world use case and differentiates it from purely speculative tokens. 	•	Revenue is already being generated, reducing dependence on speculative trading. 	•	Previous all-time high of $3 million suggests that the project has the ability to scale significantly.  MuskyDoge is at a stage where it is still under the radar but has all the necessary components for growth. The combination of a working product, a well-structured token model, and a market cap small enough to allow for significant upside potential makes it an intriguing opportunity.

Today we have an interesting topic for discussion – Dogecoin (DOGE). I noticed something interesting: the price of DOGE on Binance is 15% lower than on crypti-cronse, its price is \[0.1281 DOGE/USDT\]. This significant difference in price creates an excellent opportunity for arbitrage.      For those who are not familiar with this term, arbitrage is a trading strategy in which you buy an asset on one exchange at a lower price and sell it on another exchange at a higher price. In our case, you could buy Dogecoin on Binance and sell it on crypti-cronse, earning on the price difference.      Why is there such a difference in prices? This may be due to differences in supply and demand on these exchanges, as well as different trading volumes. But the most important thing for us is the opportunity to make money on this difference.      So, how can we take advantage of this opportunity? First, you need to have accounts on both platforms - Binance and crypti–cronse. Then, you buy Dogecoin on Binance at a lower price. After that, transfer your DOGE to Crypti-Cronse and sell them at a higher price. Do not forget to take into account the transfer and trading fees to make sure that the transaction will really be profitable.      Here are a few steps to help you get started:      Register and complete verification on both platforms.   Top up your Binance account and buy Dogecoin.   Transfer Dogecoin to your wallet on [crypti-cronse.com](http://crypti-cronse.com)   Sell Dogecoin on crypti-cronse at a higher price.   Of course, this is just one of the many strategies that can be used to trade cryptocurrencies. It is important to be aware of the risks and always conduct your own research before you start trading.      That's it, guys.

The community gathered and decided together not to stay back and immediately agreed that this was the time for a big marketing push organized on the spot amongst ourselves.  In minutes enough money was donated by the community and team to push our volume, increase exposure and to fund a campaign for all that contributed to the marketing wallet. Great moments that bring a strong team together! Moments that show what a real crypto community should be.

VoteDoge dropped to a MC of 20K but the community together with remaining part of the former OG team and active new joiners took control and brought it back to 200K in less than 24 hours.

I just stumbled across $PEP, and I think this one might be a **hidden gem**. It’s a **Proof of Work (PoW)** crypto like Doge, but it’s been optimized for **super-low fees**. Whether you're into trading or just moving funds around, it’s almost laughably cheap to use—perfect for people who want utility without breaking the bank.  Here’s why I’m excited about it:  1️⃣ **Market Cap:** As of November 29, 2024, $PEP has a market cap of approximately $22.29 million, so we’re talking early-mover advantage here. The volume is starting to pick up, but it’s still in its infancy, so it feels like we’re in the calm before the storm.  2️⃣ **Built on Solid Foundations:** $PEP is a **fork of Doge**, meaning it’s backed by the same proven tech but tweaked to make it even better for everyday use. Think Doge vibes but optimized.  3️⃣ **Ultra-Low Fees:** This is the kicker. Sending $PEP costs next to nothing. In a world where some chains are plagued with insane gas fees, this feels like a breath of fresh air.  4️⃣ **Active Community:** The devs are **super engaged**, and the community is small but growing fast. You know how important that grassroots energy is for these kinds of projects.

CryptoMoonShots,ONI | $ONI doges brother ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1egamm1/oni_oni_doges_brother/,7/31/2024,72,"alright everyone listen up, i've got something special for you today. we're talking about $oni chan, the older brother of the legendary doge kabosu and the rising star ginnan. now, you might be thinking, how can a cat coin in a cat market stand out? let me tell you why $oni is the one, why it's different, and why it's going to catch up and surpass its younger siblings.  first off, look at the fundamentals. neiro hit 80m. ginnan hit 40m. and here we have oni sitting at a humble 80k. that’s right, it’s a cat coin that’s been flying under the radar, but not for long. the community is strong, i’m talking 24/7 raids since launch, nonstop action. the mod team is spread across different timezones ensuring that the momentum never stops. we’ve got open vc round the clock, always buzzing with activity. there’s a sense of unity here that you don’t see every day. we are one. we are $oni.  let’s not forget the visuals. lots of cute pictures and videos flooding the feeds, drawing in more and more people every day. and the ticker? incredible. $oni stands out. it's memorable, it's catchy, it’s destined to be a household name.  now, let's talk about the heart of it all – the narrative. oni is the older brother, he's wiser, he's been around longer, but sometimes being older means you’re a bit slower to catch on. but that’s okay, because while he might be slower out of the gate, he’s got the experience and the staying power to catch up and then some. it's not just about fast gains, it’s about sustained growth and lasting impact. i believe in $oni, because i believe in the strength of the community and the power of the narrative.  so here’s the thesis: $oni isn’t just another coin, it’s a story. a story of an older brother stepping out of the shadows, ready to take his rightful place alongside and above his siblings. it's a coin in a market primed for a breakout, backed by a community that's passionate, relentless, and dedicated. they say slow and steady wins the race, and in the case of $oni, i truly believe that.  we are $oni. and we’re just getting started.  ca- 3Ubw3KY2Z5yKUd5ZoanAhmPc57SKd8bLHdYjN7C4pump  Telegram  /onichanoni  X @ onichansol","Be sure to do your own diligence.

The team’s been grinding on this for years, and right now, it’s sitting at a tiny $10K market cap. This could be a hidden gem—a lottery ticket waiting to pay off big.  DMP4om35PFGVpmbs2TsGGBUDAUDCHFDhiodGVwZ8pump  Even tossing in just $5 and letting it ride could turn into something huge. Back in the day, the all-time high hit $3 million, and that was before any real utility. Now, things are looking even better.  Why It Stands Out  Gaming Revenue Driving Growth  The team launched Backyard Paintball, a game on both app stores that’s already bringing in revenue. Sure, it’s a bit “pay-to-win,” but the important part is that profits are being used to support the MuskyDoge ecosystem. Growth is consistent, and the momentum is building.  Tokenomics That Work 	•	8.35% of the supply is burned, so supply is shrinking over time. 	•	The team has also bought back 2.47%, further boosting stability. 	•	No transaction taxes—that’s right, 100% tax-free. It’s built like a real business, not just another hype token.  More Than Just a Token  MuskyDoge isn’t your average cryptocurrency. It’s a utility project with a clear goal: to bridge gaming and crypto in a sustainable, rewarding way. The focus is on long-term value, not quick gimmicks.  Why Now?  The project is still low market cap, which means there’s tons of potential for early supporters. Whether you’re a hardcore investor or just someone curious about crypto, this is the perfect time to get involved.  Check out muskydoge.net for all the details and updates. Sometimes, even a small step can lead to something massive.  DMP4om35PFGVpmbs2TsGGBUDAUDCHFDhiodGVwZ8pump  Let’s grow this together!","Be sure to do your own diligence.

A strong focus of course was and is still seen to play on the US elections but it ain't stop there.  Like any campaign and presidential candidate also VoteDoge had good and bad times. After a strong start and riding the memecoin hype to an ATH of 2.8M MC, we had a correction. Jeeters entered and left, leaving their trails in the chart. The real test came when part of the original dev team left and rugged the community. We touched a low of 20K but recovered in less than 24 hours to 250K. This showed the determination, resilience and strength of the community and the remaining team.  Copycats entered which shows that Votedoge is seen and a terrific meme with a strong potential towards the elections. Yesterday another, I would almost say, murder attempt was done on VoteDoge. Big whales that were 'helping us' dumped on us even taking a team member along.   This is what crypto world seems to be; a bunch of unreliable individuals, hunting down their own personal benefit only.  VoteDoge and it's team is different and want in no way to be compared with others and other coins that are there for the quick gain, those that rug and leave the normal people behind with losses. We are transparent, open and act in full transparency and honesty with our community.  Yesterday's attack failed, the dip was bought, mostly in the hands of strong believers, community members that love and care for the meme. Like in real politics and campaigns,  VoteDoge only came out stronger and it's community is even more determined than ever.  **VoteDoge is there and ain't leaving!

With less than a month to go, it's crunch time to convince the folks out there to vote for one of them.  **More than six months ago, when VoteDoge started, there was a fear that VoteDoge would overtake the elections** and get more votes than any of the other candidates. A lot has changed since then.  Biden dropped out of the race... or better, you could almost say he was pushed out since the group behind him lost faith.  Something similar happened to VoteDoge!  After reaching an ATH of 2.8M and subsequent correction, the campaign team (read: original Devs) stepped out of the race and rugged the community. However, the community showed their strength and resilience, resulting in a recovery from 20k to over 250K in less than a day. Part of the original team, extended with some other community members, took control and started to prepare plans for a strong comeback in the election race.  Not having the power of a campaign team and funds like Kamala, this unfortunately takes a bit longer than expected... but you will see a strong revival!  A lot is being worked on behind the scenes, and VoteDoge will enter the last part of the campaign stronger than ever!  **Polls have been wrong before, and this time the final polls will still show VoteDoge as the winner of the elections!** The 250M coins, representing the number of eligible voters, will be in the hands of a strong community of believers and HODLERs by then.

By tomorrow, November 5th, the market will likely see a massive shakeup as coins tied to specific candidates or parties plummet if their side loses.  Many political coins are taking a huge risk tied to one candidate’s win, meaning they could crash hard overnight.  **But not VoteDoge!**  Unlike those coins, VoteDoge is completely independent and here to stay, no matter who takes office.  While other coins face the threat of wiping out depending on results, VoteDoge keeps rising with the election hype and continues its satirical journey well beyond U.S. politics.  We’re not tied to any candidate or party; we’re here for the memes, for the long haul, and we’re going global.  Think of it: after the U.S. election, VoteDoge takes on the world stage with major elections like Canada and Germany in 2025. From Trudeau to Scholz, no politician is safe from VoteDoge’s satire.  This coin is set to bring meme culture and laughs across borders, targeting political figures around the globe and keeping the hype alive far beyond the U.S. election.  **Why Buy Now?** The floor’s currently around $30-40K, but with enough support, VoteDoge has the potential to skyrocket.  The election hype right now is at an all-time high, and it’s only the beginning. Take a ride up with VoteDoge towards inauguration and international elections; early investors stand to gain big.  Don’t miss your chance to be part of a global movement! Get in now, while the market is prime, and help us take VoteDoge to the next level!

CryptoMoonShots,HOGE - the Doge of DeFi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1h3g7iw/hoge_the_doge_of_defi/,11/30/2024,0,"**HOGE** is a token that rewards patience, values community, and builds scarcity into its DNA. It’s not just a crypto asset; it’s a deflationary masterpiece that’s changing the game for decentralized finance. If you’re curious about where the future of finance is headed, you’ve just found your answer. If you're looking for something that will give you a fantastic nest egg for retirement with a built-in hedge against inflation, you've just found the answer. If you're looking for a crypto that has massive passive earning potential for early holders, .  # A Team That Stands the Test of Time  The crypto space is littered with projects that promise the world but disappear when the going gets tough. HOGE is different. Through every market shift, the faithful members of the Hoge team has stood firm, proving their commitment to the project’s vision. They’ve shown up when it mattered most, building a legacy of resilience and innovation. It’s rare to find a team this dedicated—and that alone speaks volumes about HOGE’s staying power.  # Scarcity That Drives Value  What makes HOGE truly unique is its deflationary nature. With 60.78% of the supply already burned, only 39.22% remains. And it’s not static—it’s shrinking with every transaction. Here’s how it works:  * 2% of every transaction is automatically split off by the smart contract. * A portion of each transaction is permanently burned, reducing the total supply. * Another portion is reflected directly to holders, rewarding them just for holding.  This creates a perfect storm of scarcity and value growth. The less HOGE there is, the more valuable it becomes. It’s a true inflation hedge, designed to reward those who see the big picture. And here’s the kicker: the longer you hold, the more you benefit.  # Decentralization Done Right  HOGE isn’t controlled by a central authority or influenced by a single entity. Its contract is renounced and permanent, ensuring no one can tamper with its mechanics. This is DeFi in its purest form.  But what truly sets HOGE apart is its community wallet, currently worth over $438,141.46. Managed through a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), every holder gets a voice in deciding how these funds are spent. And because the bulk of that wallet is in HOGE, when it inevitably gets to Doge market-cap levels, HOGE will have a financial backing unlike any other token! Whether it’s marketing, development, or even charitable initiatives, the community will decide how to spend the funds. This isn’t just decentralization—it’s empowerment.  # The Doge of DeFi  HOGE has earned its nickname as the “Doge of DeFi”—not just because of its playful energy but because it combines the best of meme culture with serious financial innovation. While Doge brought humour and accessibility to crypto, HOGE takes it a step further by offering real utility and a community-first approach.  # The Earning Potential: Holding HOGE  Let’s talk numbers. Imagine holding a significant amount of HOGE and watching your portfolio grow—not just from price appreciation but from daily reflections. Here’s the math:  * As a holder, you receive a portion of every transaction based on your share of the remaining supply. * When HOGE achieves the market cap of Doge, these daily reflections could become life-changing. For example, if you’re holding 100 million HOGE tokens (a realistic investment for many early adopters), your daily reflections could amount to hundreds of dollars at scale!  Now consider the deflationary mechanics. Every transaction burns a portion of the supply, meaning your share grows relatively larger over time. The more people use HOGE, the more scarce it becomes—and the more valuable your holdings are. It’s a system that rewards commitment and patience with exponential earning potential!  # Looking Ahead: A Future Fueled by Community  The vision for HOGE isn’t just theoretical—it’s unfolding right now. With its shrinking supply, community-driven governance, and a deflationary model that benefits every holder, HOGE is building a sustainable ecosystem for long-term success. And when it hits the market cap of Doge, it won’t just be a milestone—it’ll be a movement.  # Why HOGE? Why Now?  HOGE isn’t just another cryptocurrency. It’s a chance to be part of something bigger—a decentralized, community-driven project with real earning potential and a clear roadmap for the future. If you’re looking for a token that rewards your patience, values your input, and creates value over time, HOGE is calling your name. Why Now? Because ETH is finally ready to go mainstream, and it needs a flagship memecoin with massive growth potential that illustrates the power and uniqueness of DeFi. HOGE is that flagship.  So, the question is: will you answer? The future of DeFi is here, and it’s written in bold letters—H-O-G-E. Don't miss the boat like you did with Doge, Shiba, Folk & Wif.  Ride this sucker to the moon!","Be sure to do your own diligence.

Why?  \- Jan 29th is Lunar New Year (""Chinese New Year ""), and 2025 is the year of the snake. This is a multi-week celebration in some Asian countries, they take it seriously, and they believe that things related to snakes will bring them good luck. Many westerners invested in crypto will also be looking for snake related coins knowing that these are going to boom. Snakewifhat is the original snake coin. It's currently a little more than 2 months old now and has shown its ability to survive, making it the prime target for those thinking about Lunar New Year/year of the snake and crypto. Even better, Snakewifhat wasn't meant to be a short term, chinese new year, coin. It is intended to be a long term coin that joins the ranks of pepe, shib, wif, etc., in the high marketcaps. Don't settle for a fake snake coin designed to pumpndump/rugpull over the next couple days, get the real thing with Snakewifhat.  \- Big announcement inbound, today or tomorrow. The devs have let everyone know that they were working on a deal that will be way better than a CEX listing. It must be huge! But what else has the dev team done? Well, we are listed on CEXs Lbank and Ascendex, Lbank being based in Hong Kong and a big deal for Asian markets. They created, and got verified, a Weibo account which is constantly growing, and they are marketing on there. Also a big deal for Asian markets. They got Snakewifhat listed on CMC awhile ago. They have a 3rd CEX ready to go under optimal market conditions, soon to be listed. They are working on a rebranding to boost growth. There is a partnership with [memecoin-merch.com](http://memecoin-merch.com/) to sell physical Snakewifhat merchandise with the proceeds funding a marketing wallet. Whatever the inbound announcement is, for it to top these, it must be huge. A massive green spike is sure to follow! This is the best dev team that I have seen.  \- Our community is like none other. We are always growing. We are growing despite so much sent our way. We have seen big whale dumps, some done maliciously trying to destroy us. We get constant FUD sent our way from weird hater/almost stalker types who for some reason are threatened by the prospect of our success. We even had a group so threatened by us that they raided our Telegram with report bots to get us taken down, (we regrouped just fine). We have stayed resilient each and every time, even when a president was trying to suck all the liquidity out of the market, causing everything to fall. The community believes in this coun and the heights it can reach. This is a number one driver of a coins success. We are all in it for the long haul.  Snakewifhat has everything going for it to be the top coin of the year. This is why you see so much of us. The question is, are you going to join? At the end of this bull run, do you want to be crying happy tears because you made the best financial choice of your life? Or do you want to cry sad tears, because, yet again, you decided to sit out, see where it goes, only to wish you'd gotten in from the start? We've seen it before with coins like WIF, PEPE, SHIB, DOGE, even BTC (really wish I didn't blow off that one). We'll see it again with $SSSSS.

Part of the former DEV team left and sold off their coins...you could almost say we were really f*cked or rugged by them.  But the community and part of the team that was still there stepped up and took full control over VoteDoge. **This is what you call a real DTO, a Democratic Take Over**! As a result VoteDoge dipped initially but was immediately bought up again by clever new joiners that were eagerly waiting for a better moment to buy in and recovered strongly within the next 24 hours. This shows the resilience, strength and determination of the community as well as the strength and potential of the coin!  VoteDoge is way more than it’s leader.  It’s way more than it’s team.  It’s a community.  It’s an idea. It’s a movement.  In the coming period you can expect a lot and this will not be restricted by 'playing' the united states elections only. VoteDoge will go even more global than seen today!  We will continue to go out on the street and visit the real life community. However, as a crypto president in-the-making, VoteDoge will not ignore the US elections and present himself as the better alternative, the alternative for those that recognize the political dissidence and strive for freedom and independent thought.  You have seen a lot by us already; - a plane banner flying above the first presidential debate in Atlanta - billboards in a.o Vegas - mobile truck billboards on the street during the Republican as well as Democratic National Convention  - meeting at the Big Ben in London - community campaigns and challenges  - X spaces - a great CGI video; https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoinmoonshots/s/5wvIIh57n3  Way more is in the making and to come! We are not yet going to relief it now, but you will be surprised!  VoteDoge will be seen and is convinced that organic growth is the way to go!  We will do this on the strength and actions of the community, people who believe in the  VoteDoge project and are invested themselves. Since we are a real DTO now, and will be a successful one, you can expect some rebranding going forward. But no doubt: we will remain strong as ever, active as ever!  Curious?

This is something we strongly condemn as (real) VoteDoge team and (at least the biggest part of) our community. We have learned our lesson after being 'rugged' by part of the former Dev team. We stand for honesty and reliability and to bring a change in the crypto world.

Know that you can find a better home, a better community with the real VoteDoge. We stand for honesty and although we do realize that we are in the end all there to make money, we also know  that it takes efforts, determination and faith as a united group to make it happen in a fair and responsible way. And yes, we are also hampered by Jeeters in reaching our goals, but we will not give up and know it will happen one day!  **Yesterday was the day that  Votedoge’s success has been seen and acknowledged.**  We call all who have been rugged as well as others who have the same belief, willing to HODL and to stand strong and united, to buy VoteDoge and to join our community.

A lot of new coins look interesting but mostly after a pump and dump by the team or jeeters leave us, the normal people and investors, with empty hands behind. Out of those coins that are there for a longer time you still have a lot of options and still hard to make the right, often very personal, choice.  For me personally, after seeing **$VoteDoge** already a few months ago, I got convinced that this is the right choice for me. **$VoteDoge exists for more than 5 months and is nicely playing the upcoming elections** but clearly also one of his kind.  Since $VoteDoge is not associated with any of the parties or political persons, it can run the elections on own strengths and the character can, next to the elections in the United States, connect to any other election as well as take a presidential view on any other theme. For this reason I am convinced $VoteDoge is here to stay during the elections bug also forever after!  Another aspect is **the strong community supporting $VoteDoge**, very engaged, fun to be part of and determined to make VoteDoge a success. Which other community has been this visible with real life campaigns already with this relatively low market cap?  Also in the upcoming week a mobile billboard truck promoting $VoteDoge at the democratic National Convention in Chicago has been planned for and more is yet to come !

CryptoMoonShots,Kendu Is Leading The Way Again - Kendu Video Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1jililm/kendu_is_leading_the_way_again_kendu_video_games/,3/24/2025,115,"**Incase You Haven't Heard About Kendu**  Kendu is a memecoin that is on 3 chains: Ethereum, Solana and BASE, Kendu is focused on organic, non KOL, growth. We are entirely community led, focusing on both social media and IRL events/products. Kendu has completely captured social media, I am sure you would heard about Kendu or at least seen our name somewhere. We have around 18k holders and this is growing even in this market. Kendu ATH Market Cap was 283 million, back in June 2024, which is around a 30x from this value. Since then Kendu has went through some painful redistributions, which all coins will need to go through at some point. However, when ETH wakes up, we are pretty confident Kendu is guaranteed to reach ATH. In my opinion(not financial advice), buying Kendu at this price removes all risk from the investment. In the community, we are planning to have multiple more chill VCs in the telegram, which I welcome everyone to join, whether you are a holder or not.  Josh is also gonna start some X(Twitter) spaces on the main Kendu account, which I advise everyone to join, to get a taste of Kendu. In addition, any holders should also join this.  Kendu has multiple international communities incase English is not your first language: India, Spanish, Arabic,  French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese,  Indonesian, Korean, Thai, Turkish, Zulu.  **Other IRL Products/Events**  Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu pendants and recently Kendu Beer.   Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami   Kendu is a head sponsor at Miami Music Week. StaySeaArt, Inkstradamus and NoSleep305 have played a significant role in this. The group are giving out lots of Kendu Energy, yes we have an energy drink, they have created a Kendu Energy cocktail menu and are giving out merch. These are certified Kendu Legends!!! Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.   Kendu is also featuring on Florida Radio Stations:Revolution 93.5 and University of Miami Radio Station WVUM.  **Kendu Conquest**  Kendu Celt and Kendu GNX have teamed up and created a board game called ""Kendu Conquest"". This is an extremely well designed board game, which can be played with family or friends. Kendu once again showcases community spirit. Massive respect to those 2 Chads.  **Kendu Games**  Coop Velociraptor and a few other guys have been working on Kendu Games, whilst a lot of the game is still a secret. What we do know is that it is a 2D platform RPG and there are no crypto or NFTs in the game. The company will use a portion of net profits off of sales of the game to buy and hold Kendu (effectively a constantly growing burn wallet). This sounds like a great idea and the game will be available on Steam and it will be able to port to consoles. This will not be a blockchain game.  **A Few Interesting Ideas**  Shib, Doge and Pepe have shown what sort of potential organic memecoins have, it shows that there is no ceiling for growth. The fact that Shib went from 22 million market cap to 22 billion in 36 days. Yes you read that right..... 36 days. Kendu has been recognised by mutliple crypto OGs. These people all see the potential in Kendu, we are creating a recipe to take over both IRL and social media. Kendu is the Shib 2021 opportunity, all the signs are there, Shib was at a similar MC at this point in the cycle(this cycle seems to be more delayed compared to 2021). Kendu is focused on running it up the same way the other MemeCoin Hall of Famers have done in the past. Kendu is unstoppable and we continue working in this market!!!  In terms of social media presence, Kendu has the potential to take over levels peak Shiba Inu had reached in 2021.   Kendu can easily 1453x this year at the time of writing this post. In my opinion we can 3000x but I am a dreamer lol.  I advise you to join our telegram or our subreddit, but our tg is far busier. Even if you don't hold a bag join us and check us out. Ask any questions you want, we are a very welcoming community : )   Skip the Five Guys and put the money into Kendu, $15 can easily become $15000.  It is your choice Anon, this is your opportunity to join a community destined to cement it's legacy in crypto history. Join the winning team, we are $KENDU.  We Don't Gamble, We Work!!!

They launch with pre-mines, insider allocations, and vanish just as quickly—**99% of them end in rug pulls**.    **Pepecoin ($PEP) is built differently.** It’s a **true Layer 1 blockchain** with real decentralization, merged mining security, and a team that includes **a former Dogecoin core developer from the 2013 Doge team**, bringing real experience to the project.    🐸 **Fair launch, no insider risk** – No pre-mine. No VC funding. No team-held supply. The top wallets are all exchanges or mining pools, and **no single wallet holds more than 5%** of the supply—making rug pulls virtually impossible.    🐸 **Merged mining with Litecoin & Dogecoin** – $PEP runs on the Scrypt algorithm and is **securely mined alongside DOGE and LTC**, benefiting from strong hash power and decentralization.    🐸 **True Layer 1 infrastructure** – Pepecoin isn’t just another token living on someone else’s chain. It has its **own independent blockchain**, meaning it doesn’t rely on Ethereum’s congestion or Solana’s centralized structure.    🐸 **Tangem hardware wallet support is here** – Pepecoin’s **co-branded Tangem wallets sold out faster than any other project except one**, according to Tangem. **Integration into the Tangem app is expected by the end of April**, offering a secure cold storage option for long-term holders.    🐸 **Multiple exchanges already live** – You can currently trade $PEP on **MEXC,** [**BIT.com**](http://BIT.com)**, Coinex, Stakecube, NonKYC, and Dex-Trade**, with more listings coming soon.    🐸 **Strong and growing community** –  25.9K members in the official subreddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pepecoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pepecoin/)  10.3K+ members in Discord: [https://discord.gg/z72Jnh4K](https://discord.gg/z72Jnh4K)  7.3K+ followers on Twitter/X: [https://twitter.com/PepecoinNetwork](https://twitter.com/PepecoinNetwork)    🐸 **Undervalued with massive upside** – With a **market cap around $30M**, Pepecoin is still early.

But the problem? Most meme coins are just **ERC-20 tokens with no real infrastructure behind them**.    **Pepecoin ($PEP) is different.** It’s a **fully functional Layer 1 blockchain** with real security, merged mining, and **no VC manipulation**. This isn’t just another hype cycle—it’s a project with **actual blockchain fundamentals** that’s still **undervalued**.    ✅ **Not just another token—$PEP is a Layer 1 blockchain** – Unlike most meme coins that rely on Ethereum, Pepecoin has **its own blockchain**. That means **no ridiculous gas fees**, **no reliance on Ethereum’s congestion**, and **true decentralization**.    ✅ **Merged mining with Litecoin & Dogecoin** – Unlike meme coins that are purely speculative, Pepecoin is **secured by miners who also mine LTC & DOGE**. This means **actual security & network sustainability**, something almost no other meme coin offers.    ✅ **No insider pre-mines or VC allocations** – Pepecoin is a **true community coin** with **no venture capital funding, no early investor dumps, and no team allocations**. It’s one of the **few projects where retail investors aren’t at a disadvantage** from day one.    ✅ **A low market cap with high potential** – Pepecoin sits at **around a $19M market cap**, a fraction of **Dogecoin ($18B) and PEPE ($2B)**. Even a move to just **1% of Dogecoin’s market cap** would mean **a 10x from here**—and that’s still conservative.    ✅ **Growing exchange presence** – Currently listed on **MEXC,** [**BIT.com**](http://BIT.com)**, Coinex, and Stakecube**, with the **team actively working to expand listings**. Liquidity is improving, and as more major exchanges add $PEP, **exposure will only grow**.    ✅ **A strong & expanding community** – Pepecoin’s success isn’t just about fundamentals—**it has real engagement.**  **25.7K members** in the official Pepecoin **subreddit** (r/pepecoin)  **10.1K members** in the official **Discord server** (Join here: [https://discord.gg/z72Jnh4K](https://discord.gg/z72Jnh4K))  **7K+ followers** on the official **Twitter/X**    That kind of **organic community growth** is exactly what led to **Dogecoin and Shiba Inu’s rise**.

Pepecoin is a layer 1 cryptocurrency. It is its own independent blockchain. Pepecoin was created from Dogecoin. Dogecoin was chosen for a few reasons.  1. It is under active development. 2. It has merged mining support. This allows the Pepecoin network to take advantage of the 800TH/s securing the Litecoin and Dogecoin networks. 3. We wanted to bring the Dogecoin and Pepecoin communities together, and what better way to do this than by making Pepecoin from Dogecoin. **We welcome all shibes to join our community!**  # ""Why was Pepecoin created?""  The crypto market has shown a strong desire for a Pepe themed cryptocurrency. Many ERC-20 tokens were made last year in an attempt to give the people Pepecoin. However, ERC-20 tokens can never truly create a free and open Pepe cryptocurrency. ERC-20 tokens use smart contracts, which introduce trust back into the decentralization of crypto.  The creators of Pepe-ERC20 infamously blacklisted an investor's wallet worth tens of millions at the peak of its value. Additionally, they dumped trillions of coins (of which, at the time of creation, they minted for themselves) causing a market crash. Only after they took advantage of investors did they revoke the contract.  From Ethereum dependence, to high fees, to blacklisting, to minting, to liquidity pools, ERC20 tokens give coin creators too much power over investors. When the Pepe-ERC20 creators dumped their dev tokens causing a crash, that was the last straw.  We began building a Pepecoin for the people, free from smart-contracts and centralized authority.  # Mining Rewards  |Block Range|Reward in Pepecoin| |:-|:-| || |1-99,999|500,000| |100,000-199,999|250,000| |200,000-299,999|125,000| |300,000-399,999|62,500| |400,000-499,999|31,250| |500,000-599,999|15,625| |600,000+|10,000|  # Inflation Rate  Pepecoin has the same emission rate as Dogecoin, which means it's inflationary and encourages usage. Over time, Pepecoin's inflation rate will gradually decrease in terms of its percentage of the total supply. After the 600,000th block is mined, about 5.256 billion coins will be added each year, but as the total supply grows, this fixed annual addition represents a smaller percentage of the total supply each year, thereby reducing its inflationary impact.  # Official Communities  * Reddit: [r/Pepecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecoin/) * Discord: [pepecoin.org/discord](https://pepecoin.org/discord)  # Reddit Tip Bot  Pepecoin tipping is supported, not just on , but on ALL of Reddit!

CryptoMoonShots,Kendu - The Community that Doesn't Sleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1jppycs/kendu_the_community_that_doesnt_sleep/,4/2/2025,79,"**Kendu Introduction**  Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.   Kendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million and Kendu has went through several redistribution periods.   Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.   Kendu is more than a memecoin, we are a BRAND.  Kendu has a heavy focus on IRL products and events which I am covering below!!!  **Current market conditions**  This is for sure worse than we expected at this point in the year, it is April tomorrow and things are well for lack of a better word….. fucked. However “All Things Must Pass” (I hope someone gets this reference) and things will get better, the cycle looks delayed but no one really knows. I believe 100% that there is a bull run coming and even if not, Pepe achieved a market cap of 11 billion without a bull run and Kendu can too. There is far more money in crypto now, so 11 billion mc is equivalent to probably double that now and 20 billion is a 2000x from here for Kendu.  In terms of the market:  As Satoshi Nakamoto said “If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.”  However I will try and convince you to buy Kendu :)  **Why Kendu is organic**  Kendu is organic because organic memecoins tend to generate more results, whilst KOL based memes have a ceiling, organic memecoins are decentralised. Example of organic memecoins are Pepe, Doge and the one and only Shib.  Shib went from 22 million market cap to 22 billion market cap in 36 days, you could have turned $1000 to $1,000,000 in 36 days.   Current market cap is not the most important, since crypto moves so fast.  **The Kendu Brand**  Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami   Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far  Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy), merch and I am pretty sure a new mural  From India to Miami. Kendu is truly global  Kendu also has many tattoos, which show ultimate levels of conviction, Kendu has overtaken people's lives and is not to be missed out on. In my opinion at least put $50 in Kendu. This could buy you a new BMW or Mercedes in the future.  I want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)  Always remember, to never bet against a community  We Don't Gamble, We Work  [r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)  ETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  SOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45  BASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7  CG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)   CMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)","Be sure to do your own diligence.

When I ran some tests to see which community was the most active and responded the most, I was sold.  The Kendu community was so consistent in both up and down times. It’s insane the output these guys have.  Both online and IRL! So many great initiatives, ideas and projects are being worked on under the $KENDU umbrella.

CryptoMoonShots,Kendu - Setting the Kendu Standard,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1js21cn/kendu_setting_the_kendu_standard/,4/5/2025,78,"**Kendu Introduction**  Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is just over a year old, we are on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.   Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.   Kendu has an incredible amount of IRL products and events which I am covering below!!!  See the bottom paragraph to read about the **Kendu Standard**  **The Kendu Brand**  Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.   It is crazy that we have all these products at a market cap of 12 million, Kendu is doing all of this whilst most of its holders are down.... Imagine what will happen when Kendu's holders are millionaires, with a lot of money to create!!!  Kendu Creator is a website that allows people to 3d print a Kendu mask to make videos on social media. These videos can be non crypto related like taekwondo or running or weightlifting, with these videos flooding social media, Kendu is gonna extend its reach even further!!!    If one of these videos go viral, Kendu will see massive gains  Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami   Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far. Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy) and merch.  **Some Thoughts About Previous Successful Coins**  Shib had a ATH of 44 billion in the bull run in 2021, Pepe had an ATH of 10 billion in a bear market..... In both situations there was far less money in crypto, yet these coins reached face melting ATHs.    Shib, Doge and Pepe all proved that all you need is a solid community, KOLs don't matter and that the only thing you need is an army of obsessed workers. This is what Kendu has.   With more money in crypto, far more understanding and belief in memecoins and a proven path, Kendu can top the highs of the previous memecoin hall of famers, Kendu belongs up there with them.   Kendu is everywhere on social media and we are matching what Pepe, Shib and Doge managed on their run to the top.   IRL we clear every memecoin ever, all the signs are there  At Kendu, the mission is simple.... we build, build, build until we reach the stars.  **The Kendu Standard**  What is the Kendu Standard?  It is the standard to which Kendu is setting, the standard to which all memecoins will aim to meet after Kendu runs to the billions. Kendu is revolutionising the game with its IRL products and events, the sheer amount of quality and quantity of Kendu's IRL alpha has never been seen or done before..... no coin comes close.   The Kendu standard is the metrics we try and hit when we engage with social media posts and it is the standard we give ourselves.   Shib, Pepe, Doge or whatever coin that has existed before, has came nowhere near to Kendu's IRL expeditions and soon with enough holders, Kendu will top every coin in social media metrics. This is the Shib opportunity of 2025, but we are not copying Shib, we are transforming the memecoin game.  **Join the winning team, join Kendu**  Check out our tg, you don't need to be a holder and just get a feel for the Kendu vibe. I am sure you will love it : ) We are a very welcoming and hard working community and any questions are always welcome!

It’s no surprise that **most end up as rug pulls**, leaving regular investors holding the bag.    **Pepecoin ($PEP) breaks that mold.** It’s a **true Layer 1 blockchain** with real infrastructure, no insider supply, and **security through merged mining with Litecoin and Dogecoin**. It’s built to last, not just pump.    🐸 **Fair Launch & Decentralized Supply** – No pre-mine, no team allocation, and no VC control. No wallet or entity holds more than 5% of the supply. The **top wallets are all exchanges or mining pools**, meaning there’s **no risk of a rug pull**.    🐸 **Merged Mining with DOGE & LTC** – Pepecoin uses the **scrypt algorithm**, allowing it to be mined alongside Litecoin and Dogecoin. This gives it a strong, secure, and decentralized foundation.    🐸 **Tangem Hardware Wallet** – Pepecoin recently launched **co-branded hardware wallets with Tangem**, and according to Tangem, it became **the fastest-selling wallet they’ve ever had—second only to one other coin**. Full **integration into the Tangem app is expected by the end of April**, providing users with a secure, self-custody option.    🐸 **Listed on Multiple Exchanges** – $PEP is live on **MEXC, BIT .com, Coinex, Stakecube, NonKYC, and Dex-Trade**, with **more exchanges on the way** to improve accessibility and liquidity.    🐸 **Rapidly Growing Community:**  25.8K members in the official **subreddit**: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pepecoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pepecoin/)  10.2K+ members in the **Discord**: [https://discord.gg/z72Jnh4K](https://discord.gg/z72Jnh4K)  7.3K+ followers on **Twitter/X**: [https://twitter.com/PepecoinNetwork](https://twitter.com/PepecoinNetwork)    🐸 **Still Early with Big Potential** – With a **market cap around $30M**, Pepecoin remains **undervalued** compared to other meme coins like Dogecoin ($25B) and PEPE ($2.5B). A move to even **1% of Doge’s market cap** would mean a **10x+ gain**.    **A Proven Track Record** – Pepecoin isn’t some recent cash grab.

If you've been following my calls, you'd know that I never miss.  $NeiRei has experienced an **insanely parabolic run** since my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1f951t3/missed_my_200x_on_ikigai_heres_another_chance/), pumping from a $600k market cap to $7 million in just a couple of weeks, organically. After some market-wide uncertainty with BTC and ETH taking a nosedive, NeiRei has seen its first dip, currently sitting at a $3 million market cap.  However, whales continue to donate to the [marketing wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1Ff5D13A9D2ff5e8cc5D6C9768D357f41697A19e), which once **held $400k**.

There’s no central party with enough power to rug—**not even hypothetically**.    🐸 **Block reward just halved** – Pepecoin recently underwent a **halving**, reducing its mining reward and cutting inflation in half—making newly minted $PEP more scarce going forward. There is 1 more halving left.     🐸 **Merged mining with DOGE & LTC** – Pepecoin can be mined alongside Litecoin and Dogecoin, benefiting from a **robust and decentralized mining ecosystem**.    🐸 **Tangem hardware wallet integration in early May** – The initial batch **Pepecoin x Tangem hardware wallets sold out quickly**, and **Tangem will integrate $PEP directly into its wallet app by the start of May**, giving holders secure cold storage access.    🐸 **Now available for direct purchase with card** – You can now **buy $PEP directly from** [**https://pepecoin.org**](https://pepecoin.org/) using **Alchemy Pay**, which lets you pay with a **debit or credit card**—no centralized exchange required.    🐸 **Listed on multiple exchanges** – $PEP is live on **MEXC,** [**BIT.com**](http://BIT.com)**, Coinex, Stakecube, NonKYC, and Dex-Trade**, with **additional listings on the way**.    🐸 **Backed by a growing community**  26K members on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pepecoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pepecoin/)  10.4K+ in Discord: [https://discord.gg/z72Jnh4K](https://discord.gg/z72Jnh4K)  7.3K+ on Twitter/X: [https://twitter.com/PepecoinNetwork](https://twitter.com/PepecoinNetwork)    Pepecoin currently has a **market cap of around $24M**—tiny compared to Dogecoin ($26B) and PEPE ($3.5B).

I’ve personally **spent almost $200k** into marketing, burns, buybacks, memes, video content, market makers, meme contests, and much more. We were able to hit a $7M market cap after starting at around $500k when I first shared NeiRei on Reddit. Now, following a **two-month-long accumulation** phase, NeiRei is ready for its next run.  The extended accumulation phase was designed to get rid of weak hands and replace them with diamond-handed holders who are committed to pushing this project to the next level.  This week, I’ve secured **BTOK’s #1 trending ads** for NeiRei. They start running today! For those unfamiliar, **BTOK is essentially the Chinese version of Telegram**, and since most of the crypto community—especially in the memecoin space—uses Telegram, targeting the Chinese audience makes perfect sense. After all, **NeiRei is the Chinese Neiro**! BTOK ads aren't cheap either... They cost $3k/day so come in and help out the community as much as possible! Extra points if you speak Mandarin :).  Additionally, we’ll be doing Dexscreener boost, using Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) for calls, activating professional raiders, and deploying market makers for volume.  If you’re a diamond hander looking to join a relentless community with the [BEST memes](https://x.com/NeiReiTokenETH/status/1864128673521258821) in the space, NeiRei is the project for you.  # Summary for the Newcomers  Just like $Peipei is the Chinese version of $Pepe, **$NeiRei is the Chinese version of $Neiro**. Peipei reached 4% of Pepe's market cap, so it’s only reasonable to assume that NeiRei could also reach **4% of Neiro’s market cap**, which would put it at **over $40M**—a 14x from here.  As most of you know (unless you've been living under a rock), **Neiro is the new Doge** of this bull run and has already surpassed $1b market cap.

And immediately after this news, dozens of memecoins named Neiro were created.  Finally, the community token Neiro CTO (ETH) was listed on Binance. The community token won PVP.  And memecoins that continue the Neiro meta began to be created. Because if there is a big runner somewhere and you missed it, you need to find alternatives.  There are 2 alternatives. BabyNeiro-25M ATH and NeiRei (Chinese Neiro) 7M ATH.  I preferred NeiRei, the Chinese Neiro, because:  Pepe's Chinese version, PeiPei reached 180m ATH. And at that time, no one was talking about Pepe. But now everyone is talking about Neiro.  Kendu, which accumulated for 4 months between 1.5M-4M, had risen 150x and a Kendu whale is leading the NeiRei CTO.  CTO members are constantly tweeting, creating anime videos and are constantly active. There is a dedicated community. The absolute condition for success.  Neiro reached 970M ATH and is currently sitting around 650m with a normal chart movement. With Neiro's fall, some panicked people emerged in NeiRei and this gave us the opportunity to enter for generations right now.  Neiro, called the new doge, will reach billions and NeiRei will achieve incredible things for this very reason.  There is a bull run right ahead and Neiro will make its mark on this bull. And of course NeiRei.  Here, gentlemen, is an entry opportunity that will never be found again for NeiRei at 2 million marketcap.  I will hold Neiro and NeiRei, the 2 memecoins that everyone will talk about during the bull run.  The decision is yours. I'm just saying.

(Department of Government Efficiency)** last week, its market cap was just sitting at $500k. Since then, it hit $2M and is now holding steady at $1.5M, looking ready for the next leg up. When will you stop fading my calls?  Once Bitcoin breaks $100k, it will be all over the news. The masses will flood into crypto markets, searching for the next big thing. **BASE chain** has been relatively quiet, making this the perfect time to get in before everyone else does.  The D.O.G.E. team on BASE has proven their trustworthiness by paying **$5k USD** for a Fast Track listing on **CoinMarketCap**. The coin is also now listed on **CoinGecko**, and I heard through the grapevines about potential exchange listings in the near future.  For context, [D.O.G.E. on Ethereum](https://www.dextools.io/app/en/token/dogegov?t=1732209998419) hit $500M with ease, the [one on Solana](https://www.dextools.io/app/en/token/dogesol?t=1732210068752) reached $100M, and now the one on Base is sitting at just $1.5M. With D.O.G.E. having relevancy for at least the next four years, and with **Trump** and **Elon** in the spotlight, it only makes sense that the Base versions follows its Ethereum and Solana counterparts.  To top it off, [Your Pop](https://x.com/Yourpop8), a popular crypto influencer, has been spotted lurking in the Telegram group. Is he interested?

Kendu is 1 year old and is backed by a rock solid community. We are arguably the strongest community in crypto right now and we are gonna get a lot stronger once the market turns(we are a sleeping giant). Kendu has 17k holders and we are growing daily. Community is the reason Doge, Shiba, Pepe and other billion dollar meme coins reached the heights they did. Kendu also has produced a lot of IRL products and events which sets us out amongst the rest, as it bridges us between the real world and crypto, this will help us onboard a lot of new investors.  **WHY DOES COMMUNITY MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE**  Community provides a coin free, 24/7 advertisement, a culture and a home for its holders. It can capture the eyes of potential holders whilst saving project funds for listings. Community is addicting, humans need interaction and that's what a community provides. At Kendu, no matter your beliefs or background you are welcome, you will make friends here and learn a hell of a lot.  **IRL EVENTS**  Kendu has a glow in the dark pickleball event in India ran by Kendu Entertainment, which is attracting lots of very reputable people  Kendu is a head sponsor of Miami Music Week which is coming on the 29th March  **IRL PRODUCTS**  Kendu Gum, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy, Kendu Pendants, Kendu Merch, Kendu VideoGames   and more  **WHY CHOOSE KENDU**  Kendu is at a very similar mc that Shib was at in Feb 2021, this means Kendu is in a position in which a 1000x is very possible. If we reached Shib's level, which is certainly possible since there is now far more money in crypto, this is over a 4000x. We have the same characteristics that Shib had. There is no reason we cannot do the same. Stop Gambling and Start Building. Join Kendu, its your   chance to retire.  Kendu’s distribution is very good, only 52% of the supply is owned by the top 100 wallets, compared to over 70% in other major memecoins. This gives Kendu way more stability and it is a great sign we will go far.  Kendu is ranked very positively by Certik(a very reputable organisation who rates the safety of a crypto)  WE DON'T GAMBLE, WE WORK  Subreddit: [r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem](/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/) (you can ask any questions here and find our tg)  [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)  [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)","Be sure to do your own diligence.

CryptoMoonShots,An honest story about a average young male buying his first house with Memecoin profits!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1h0bgas/an_honest_story_about_a_average_young_male_buying/,11/26/2024,635,"Hey guys, I have been writing Reddit posts more often since I started my memecoin Journey in March this year. I try to make relatable posts for normal investors and I try to be as honest as possible.   First some background, Im in my 20’s and living with my parents in Europe. Im working in heatlhcare and I have got a average salary. My Girlfriend and I are looking to buy a house together but its absolutely impossible where I live without bringing a big bag of money.   This is where $Hege came into my life. I have been buying/holding/trading Cryptocurrency since 2017. Never had the right budget/knowledge/mindset to really make money. Yes I was early on coins like Verge/Litecoin/Doge/Shiba and several others but was never able to hold untill the moonshot. Im afraid to look back at my past since I have had the change to be a millionair more then twice if I just held…   In April I started investing in $Hege, started with a 35 dollar buy. I slowly increased my bag. I have traded and DCA’d my way up to 2 million tokens in 7 months. I have been holding on to my investment and I have been working for it to! I have made countless Reddit posts, done 1000’s of raids and I came up with several competitions to engage the community.   My total investment in $Hege was 7500 Dollars in the course of 7 months. If my GF and I want to buy a house we need to bring 100.000$ total. For us to work this together it would take us over 5 years each before getting close while living on small money.   As we speak Hege dipped back to a market cap of 22 million after an insane price surge towards a ATH of 31 million. My bag is worth over 50% of a future house. And all of this in the course of 7 months. We all know the Bullrun is just getting started and so is $Hege.   Hege is getting listed on AscendEX this week and the team is announcing a even bigger CEX this week. When the market picks up and bounces I expect Hege to run to a new ATH very soon!   Some people might have seen previous posts I did, in my latest one from a couple weeks ago I stated Hege would hit a new ATH after I got some inside info. Well it happened.   I am not planning on selling my whole Hege bag when I see 100.000$ in my wallet. I know Hege has potential to reach 100 mil market cap this year. I expect it to go well into the hundred millions next year since the team is always performing and the community is growing rapidly. The 100.000$ will be small compared tot he potential of $Hege.    After fading and selling DOGE/SHIBA/TRON/VERGE and others to early it wont happen to my ever again!   I will proudly show you guys our first House bought with gains from HEGECOIN, and remember to always DCA in and DCA out!  https://linktr.ee/hegefund","Be sure to do your own diligence.

CryptoMoonShots,Kendu - The Diamond Opportunity is Here,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1jnb40t/kendu_the_diamond_opportunity_is_here/,3/30/2025,92,"**A Quick Introduction**       Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.   Kendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million, Kendu has went through several redistribution periods and at the time of writing has had 7 green days in a row.   Kendu is following the same path that Pepe, Shib and Doge created back when they ran to the billions. This process typically takes longer than a KOL based memecoin, but it has a much higher potential for returns. Furthermore, this method is tried and tested, all we need to do is push Kendu along that same path.   Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.   Kendu has great distribution too, which is getting better all the time, our holders seem to grow daily even in the terrible market.   Kendu has lots of IRL products which bridge DEFI to the real world, this is very attractive to retail investors, as IRL products show authenticity.   Kendu is more than a memecoin, we are a BRAND.   What makes me insanely bullish is the fact that even when many people could have lost a lot of money in the markets downturn, Kendu still pumps out IRL products. Imagine what will happen when Kendu is in the billions :0     **IRL Products and Events**  Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.   Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami   Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.  From India to Miami. Kendu is truly global  **Miami Music Week**  Miami Music Week is kicking off and Kendu is a head sponsor of this. This is absolutely massive as around 165,000 people are expected to go. StaySeaArt, NoSleep305 and Inkstradamus are leading the charge in the Miami heat :)   Kendu Energy, Kendu Merch and cocktails made from Kendu Energy will be given out to the attendees of this event.    NoSleep305 were behind the iconic Kendu Mural in Miami and Inkstradamus are making the Kendu Merch. Whilst StaySeaArt designed the Kendu Cocktail Menu. They will go down in Kendu history.     **Kendu Creator**  Kendu Creator is a website created by a chad called Akabe, where you can 3d print a Kendu mask. Whilst wearing this mask, you can play drums(like Akabe), lift weights, dance, sing.... the list goes on. This is a project to get Kendu on all forms and areas of social media, this is gonna be great, soon people will be seeing drums, people singing and running all wearing a Kendu mask. This is truly a revolutionary idea and it could make Kendu viral. We also have the Akabe mask as a filter on TikTok, so you can create a TikTok video without actually printing the mask. This gives access to the Akabe mask to everyone.   Akabe has mentioned the discipline that Kendu creator has brought to his life, Kendu creator has gave him a lot of discipline to practice to drums daily to improve the content he can make. Akabe says Kendu creator gives people purpose and it pushes people to become a better version of themselves whilst pushing Kendu to the top. This is wonderful and it shows the Ken-Du mentality.  I cannot stress this enough, this is one of the best ideas that has came out of Kendu so far!!!  **What to look for in a Memecoin and why Kendu has that**  A community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto. We are at the base of the biggest AltSeason in Crypto history, we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days(with far less money in the market), so why can't Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need, so what are you waiting for?   Join the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.   Skip the Dominos Cheese Pizza and put the $15 into Kendu, where imo you could make $15000. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.   All the signs were there...  I want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)  Always remember, to never bet against a community  We Don't Gamble, We Work  [r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)  ETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  SOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45  BASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7  CG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)   CMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)","Be sure to do your own diligence.

Pepecoin is a layer 1 cryptocurrency. It is its own independent blockchain. Pepecoin was created from Dogecoin. Dogecoin was chosen for a few reasons.  1. It is under active development. 2. It has merged mining support. This allows the Pepecoin network to take advantage of the 800TH/s securing the Litecoin and Dogecoin networks. 3. We wanted to bring the Dogecoin and Pepecoin communities together, and what better way to do this than by making Pepecoin from Dogecoin. **We welcome all shibes to join our community!**  # ""Why was Pepecoin created?""  The crypto market has shown a strong desire for a Pepe themed cryptocurrency. Many ERC-20 tokens were made last year in an attempt to give the people Pepecoin. However, ERC-20 tokens can never truly create a free and open Pepe cryptocurrency. ERC-20 tokens use smart contracts, which introduce trust back into the decentralization of crypto.  The creators of Pepe-ERC20 infamously blacklisted an investor's wallet worth tens of millions at the peak of its value. Additionally, they dumped trillions of coins (of which, at the time of creation, they minted for themselves) causing a market crash. Only after they took advantage of investors did they revoke the contract.  From Ethereum dependence, to high fees, to blacklisting, to minting, to liquidity pools, ERC20 tokens give coin creators too much power over investors. When the Pepe-ERC20 creators dumped their dev tokens causing a crash, that was the last straw.  We began building a Pepecoin for the people, free from smart-contracts and centralized authority.  # Mining Rewards  |Block Range|Reward in Pepecoin| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| ||| ||| |1-99,999|500,000| |100,000-199,999|250,000| |200,000-299,999|125,000| |300,000-399,999|62,500| |400,000-499,999|31,250| |500,000-599,999|15,625| |600,000+|10,000|  # Inflation Rate  Pepecoin has the same emission rate as Dogecoin, which means it's inflationary and encourages usage. Over time, Pepecoin's inflation rate will gradually decrease in terms of its percentage of the total supply. After the 600,000th block is mined, about 5.256 billion coins will be added each year, but as the total supply grows, this fixed annual addition represents a smaller percentage of the total supply each year, thereby reducing its inflationary impact.  # Official Communities  * Reddit: [r/Pepecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecoin/) * Discord: [pepecoin.org/discord](https://pepecoin.org/discord)  # Reddit Tip Bot  Pepecoin tipping is supported, not just on , but on ALL of Reddit!

CryptoMoonShots,Why You Should Hold Kendu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1jbvmfm/why_you_should_hold_kendu/,3/15/2025,92,"This is gonna be an overview of Kendu, unfortunately due to the sheer size IRL products, events and other Kendu tales I cannot go through all of this in one post. In addition, there will be some things that I will forget, but I am gonna try my best.   **Introduction to Kendu**  Kendu is a memecoin that is on 3 chains: Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We were initially only on Ethereum but we have wormholed to the other 2 in the past few months. Kendu is focused on organic, non KOL, growth. We are entirely community led, focusing on both social media and IRL events/products. Kendu has completely captured social media, I am sure you would heard about Kendu or at least seen our name somewhere. We have 18k holders and this is growing even in this market.  **IRL Events**  Kendu has lots of events coming up and some that have already happened. In December, Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, this is a significant event, where lots of crypto enthusiasts were present. NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami.    Kendu Pickleball, in India, Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in th Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.   Over the next few weeks Kendu is the main sponsor for Miami Music Week. StaySeaArt, Inkstradamus and NoSleep305 have played a significant role in this. The group are giving out lots of Kendu Energy(yes we have energy drinks, more will be mentioned later in the post), they have created a Kendu Energy cocktail menu and are giving out merch. These are certified Kendu Legends!!!  **IRL Products**  Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu pendants and recently Kendu Beer.  **Why IRL Alpha is Important**     IRL events/products are a great way for Kendu to reach both crypto enthusiasts and non crypto people. I don't see Kendu as a basic memecoin, I see it is a multi billion dollar brand, just like Nike and Sony. Kendu is dominating and entering lots of billion dollar industries. Kendu is bridging DEFI and IRL and this is a reason Kendu is gonna be a frontrunner this year!!!  **A Few Interesting Ideas**  Shib, Doge and Pepe have shown what sort of potential organic memecoins have, it shows that there is no ceiling for growth. The fact that Shib went from 20 million market cap to 20 billion in 36 days. Yes you read that right..... 36 days. Kendu has been recognised by mutliple crypto OGs. These people all see the potential in Kendu, we are creating a recipe to take over both IRL and social media. Kendu is the Shib 2021 opportunity, all the signs are there, Shib was at a similar MC at this point in the cycle(this cycle seems to be more delayed compared to 2021). Kendu is focused on running it up the same way the other MemeCoin Hall of Famers have done in the past. Kendu is unstoppable and we continue working in this market!!!  In terms of social media presence, Kendu has the potential to take over the tsunami that was Shiba Inu.    Kendu can easily 1000x this year at the time of writing this post. In my opinion we can 3000x but I am a dreamer lol.   I advise you to join our telegram, even if you don't hold a bag. Ask any questions you want, we are a very welcoming community : ) In the TG you can find me as Luke Skywalker.    Skip the Starbucks and put the money into Kendu $10 can easily become $10000.   It is your choice Anon, this is your opportunity to cement your name in crypto history. Join the winning team, we are KENDU.   We Don't Gamble, We Work!!!

Pepecoin is a **layer 1 blockchain** – not just another token. It’s built directly from **Dogecoin**, which means:  • It benefits from **Dogecoin’s active development**.   • It supports **merged mining**, so it can use the massive hash rate from **Litecoin** and **Dogecoin** to stay secure.  The goal? Bring together Pepe fans and Dogecoin lovers into one community, powered by a proper decentralized blockchain.  # Why was Pepecoin created?  Let’s be honest – people have wanted a **Pepe-themed crypto** for a long time. Last year, a bunch of Pepe-based **ERC-20 tokens** popped up, but they came with serious problems:  • **Too centralized**: Smart contracts give developers too much control.   • **Shady moves by developers**: Wallets worth tens of millions at the peak of their value were blacklisted and trillions of coins (created for the developers themselves) were dumped, causing a price crash. The contract was only revoked *after* taking advantage of the investors.   • **High fees**: Ethereum gas fees are still extremely high.  In short, all of the above had people both disappointed and fed up. Pepecoin was built to fix this. No smart contracts, no shady business – just a **real blockchain for the people**.  # Mining Rewards  |Block Range|Reward in Pepecoin| |:-|:-| || |1-99,999|500,000| |100,000-199,999|250,000| |200,000-299,999|125,000| |300,000-399,999|62,500| |400,000-499,999|31,250| |500,000-599,999|15,625| |600,000+|10,000|  # Inflation Rate  Pepecoin follows the same emission model as Dogecoin, meaning it’s **inflationary** but encourages people to actually use it. After the **600,000th block**, about **5.256 billion coins** will be added each year. But as the supply grows, the annual addition becomes less significant – so the inflation rate drops over time.  # $PEP - Official Communities  • **Reddit**: [r/Pepecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecoin)   • **Discord**: [pepecoin.org/discord](https://pepecoin.org/discord)  Pepecoin tipping works across **all of Reddit** and on **34,000+ Discord servers** via [tip.cc](https://tip.cc/).

CryptoMoonShots,Kendu: How the Kendu Army Keeps Up An Incredible Work Ethic,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1lif8kx/kendu_how_the_kendu_army_keeps_up_an_incredible/,6/23/2025,82,"**Some Background Info**  Kendu is a memecoin backed by a plethora of IRL initiatives including plushies, vapes, vending machines, coffee, energy drinks, murals, Pickleball Competitions and much more....We are currently sitting around 20 million market cap, with around 18.5k holders and we have stood incredibly strong as the rest of the market falls due to the current wars. But anyways, I am not too interested in the wars, I am far more focused on Kendu. Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes for the free audit, the only other coin to achieve this incredible feat was Pepe, yes.....Pepe. The coin that reached 10 billion outside of a bull run, this is bullish af and it shows the true strength of Kendu. We have an incredible social media output, rivalling the most active coins, check X or any memecoin subreddit and you will see Kendu everywhere.   **The next part of the post is for a bit of fun, there are far more factors than this. For example community sentiment, tg activity and many more**  So what makes the Kendu community so active?  The answer is **copious amounts of** ...... **caffeine**  Kendu has energy drinks and coffee, which keeps the Kendu army grinding on even the slowest of days, I myself don't drink coffee, but I drink Kendu Energy.  ""How the fuck else would you do this job?""  ""Kendu Energy and Kendu Coffee my friend""  **That was stolen from the Wolf of Wall Street, don't sue me lol**  But anyways, here is a run down of the different products:  **Kendu Coffee**  Kendu Coffee is sourced through direct trade, this means there is no middle man, to ensure only the best price for the product, the coffee is available in both caffeinated and decaf forms and it is sourced from Brazil. The coffee is available in many different forms: Filter, Espresso, Whole Bean and French Press. For any Cafes or offices you can bulk order the coffee, which is great. For any UK events, there is a portable Kendu Coffee bar, which brings the coffee to you! So any UK based people should be aware of this.  In the future providing that the plants produce beans to a high standard, Kendu Coffee plants will be available.  For More Information Please Visit: [https://kenducoffee.com/](https://kenducoffee.com/)  **Kendu Energy**  Kendu Energy is an energy drink, available in both sugar free and full sugar variants, with a recent redesign, it is looking great. I have tried the full sugar version and would highly recommend it, it tastes more similar to Redbull than Monster and I am buying more shortly! They come in packs of 6, 12 and 20 and they are available worldwide, with a very strong presence in Europe and America. I am also pretty sure there is a new flavour coming out soon, as it has been teased but I don't know what it will be!  **Final Thoughts**  Get yourself on the caffeine grind and join the Kendu army, we are outworking all other projects rn and we all know what happens to the most hardworking communities, they moon..... Shib, Doge and Pepe all had die hard communities, there was nothing special about them, they just worked incredibly hard.

Coffee and energy are just a couple of them you can hold Kendu in your hands in a variety of different ways. You can est Kendu, drink Kendu, soon you'll be able to play it in your Steam store. Kendu leverage its brand to support its builders, and there is crystal clear upside for anyone who wants to build anything to build it with Kendu.  Community-as-a-service enables you to get your first few thousand users, customers, or product testers, not to mention having a 24/7 voluntary marketing force the size of an S&P500 company constantly at your disposal.  The community of holders then benefits greatly from another ecosystem participant and tangible Kendu real world presence in a symbiotic relationship between both parties, each benefiting and working for the other.

Pepecoin is a layer 1 cryptocurrency. It is its own independent blockchain. Pepecoin was created from Dogecoin. Dogecoin was chosen for a few reasons.  1. It is under active development. 2. It has merged mining support. This will allow the Pepecoin network to take advantage of the 800TH/s securing the Litecoin and Dogecoin networks. 3. We wanted to bring the Dogecoin and Pepecoin communities together, and what better way to do this than by making Pepecoin from Dogecoin. **We welcome all shibes to join our community!**  # ""Why was Pepecoin created?""  The crypto market has shown a strong desire for a Pepe themed cryptocurrency. Many ERC-20 tokens were made last year in an attempt to give the people Pepecoin. However, ERC-20 tokens can never truly create a free and open Pepe cryptocurrency. ERC-20 tokens use smart contracts, which introduce trust back into the decentralization of crypto.  The creators of Pepe-ERC20 infamously blacklisted an investor's wallet worth tens of millions at the peak of its value. Additionally, they dumped trillions of coins (of which, at the time of creation, they minted for themselves) causing a market crash. Only after they took advantage of investors did they revoke the contract.  From Ethereum dependence, to high fees, to blacklisting, to minting, to liquidity pools, ERC20 tokens give coin creators too much power over investors. When the Pepe-ERC20 creators dumped their dev tokens causing a crash, that was the last straw.  We began building a Pepecoin for the people, free from smart-contracts and centralized authority.  # Mining Rewards  |Block Range|Reward in Pepecoin| |:-|:-| || |1-99,999|500,000| |100,000-199,999|250,000| |200,000-299,999|125,000| |300,000-399,999|62,500| |400,000-499,999|31,250| |500,000-599,999|15,625| |600,000+|10,000|  # Inflation Rate  Pepecoin has the same emission rate as Dogecoin, which means it's inflationary and encourages usage. Over time, Pepecoin's inflation rate will gradually decrease in terms of its percentage of the total supply. After the 600,000th block is mined, about 5.256 billion coins will be added each year, but as the total supply grows, this fixed annual addition represents a smaller percentage of the total supply each year, thereby reducing its inflationary impact.  # Official Communities  * Reddit: [r/Pepecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecoin/) * Discord: [pepecoin.org/discord](https://pepecoin.org/discord)  # Reddit Tip Bot  Pepecoin tipping is supported, not just on [](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecoin/), but on ALL of Reddit!

The market cap is not moving much, but this just means our distribution is getting stronger. Distribution will be a very strong driving factor for success when the bull run comes, as it means the sell pressure will be very low for weeks. This means the buy pressure will all go on the chart and can cause very violent uptrends.  **What Kendu has been up to over the past few days**  [https://kenducreator.com/](https://kenducreator.com/) : This website allows every Kendu member to print a Kendu mask to be used in IRL content. This is gonna massively help the Kendu brand. This gives people the chance to wear the Kendu mask when creating other non crypto related social media content. This is gonna greatly help Kendu's chance to go viral and it will also help the Kendu brand capture every corner of the internet.  All credit to Akabe  Billboard: Kendu has yet again captured Billboard on Base. This is a place for Base coins to self advertise. The art also showcases some large accounts who have joined the Kendu Community(All organic, no paid KOLs)  All credit to Axl Rokendu  StaySeaArt's Kendu Energy cocktail Menu for Miami Event: These sound great, I wish I could go but unfortunately I am not on the same continent. The cocktails will be very refreshing, especially in the Miami Heat 😉  NoSleep305 and Inkstradamus are making merch for the Miami Event at the end of this month(I think the market will have turned around by then), this is gonna be a huge event and get a lot of eyes on Kendu.  Kendu Beer, a chad has made a piece of merchandise. These look great, although they are still in the design stage, I am sure they will pop off when ready!!!  **The Future of Kendu**  Kendu is a super strong cult memecoin ran entirely by the community. In my opinion Kendu has the potential to reach 10 billion market cap this cycle and is a multicycle project with lots of IRL products and events. Kendu is using an organic approach, the same approach used by Doge, Shib and Pepe. KOLs unfortunately limit growth, whilst good for a short period of time, the impact of a KOL will reduce meaning a coin will struggle to hold its floor. Kendu does not have this problem.  In the middle of Feb 2021 Shiba was hovering around 14 million mc. Kendu is very close to this point now. Whilst it’s March now, The cycle seemed to be far earlier in 2021 than we will see this year. It is looking more like 2016.  This is not a problem, it just means the peaks come later in the year.   Kendu is not ahead of where Shiba was but we are not behind either.

But every now and then, one project stands out. CZ’s Dog Perry ($PERRY) is a fresh contender aiming to capture the attention of crypto enthusiasts and meme coin investors alike.  What is $PERRY? $PERRY is a meme coin inspired by Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the founder of Binance, and his fictional loyal dog, Perry. Unlike many generic meme tokens, $PERRY is built around a strong narrative, a fair launch, and a highly engaged community.  Why $PERRY Could Be a Potential Moonshot Several factors contribute to the success of a meme coin: branding, community, tokenomics, and market hype. $PERRY checks all these boxes.  Fair Launch: No presale, no developer-held tokens – full transparency and decentralization. Deflationary Model: A portion of each transaction is burned, reducing the total supply over time. Community-Driven: $PERRY is powered by its holders, ensuring strong engagement and viral potential. Strategic Marketing: The team is actively working on marketing campaigns, influencer partnerships, and future exchange listings. How $PERRY Stands Out Meme coins like Doge, Shiba Inu, and Pepe have shown that strong narratives and community backing can lead to explosive growth. PERRY builds upon this foundation while introducing scarcity mechanisms and an engaging storyline tied to CZ’s crypto legacy.  Where to Buy and What’s Next? $PERRY is currently available for trading on [insert exchange or contract address]. With upcoming marketing initiatives and potential exchange listings, now could be an early entry point before the token gains mainstream attention.  Final Thoughts The success of a meme coin depends on momentum, community strength, and timing. With its unique branding and engaged supporters, CZ’s Dog Perry has all the ingredients of a viral crypto gem.  Is $PERRY the next 100x meme coin?

CryptoMoonShots,No one does it like KENDU and no one ever will,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1lcygso/no_one_does_it_like_kendu_and_no_one_ever_will/,6/16/2025,55,"When you look at coins like pepe, shib, even doge you look at the chart and see that it rose 100000x in some period of time. That gives you a feeling of FOMO where you want to find the next coin like pepe, shib or doge so you hop in the memecoin trenches and try and find a coin that is doing it similar to the ones that already ran.  The problem with this is that once a coin like this runs, the method is already done and the coins that copy it will always fall short. You can find this present today with the thousands of pepe derivatives being made every day, where not a single one has managed to capture what pepe was/is.  Spend some time with KENDU and you may see what I see here. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. I want you're mind to forget this is a memecoin post. It's time to free your mind and think a little deeper.  People working the weaving machines in the 17th century did not anticipate the steam engine, yet this was the investion that created the industrial revolution. Similarly, encyclopedia Britannica didnt see Wikipedia's emergence. Tranformation doesnt occur in incremental steps, rather it happens when someone dares to think in an entirely new way.  This is what happened in the past coins, and this is what's happening with KENDU right now. KENDU has combined the workforce of a dedicated army with creating a real world brand around the coin where anyone is free to create anything (unheard of in DeFi to the scale KENDU is working at). This isn't the only thing KENDU has going for it. The army that is constantly pushing the word of KENDU out will also naturally help KENDU grow even if the brand aspect was completely ignored. The coin is 15 months old and yet hasn't ever hit even 5% of it's true potential.  Furthermore, we aren't even in a time period where the ETH ecosystem is popping. About this time last year, there was a new ETH coin every couple days that would run straight to 100m marketcap with ease. Currently, the last runner we had was around 50m and its been a couple weeks - close to a month - since that happened. If you're getting nervous, scared or whatever the smartest thing to do right now is simply sit on your hands and be patient. Eth will be back and with it will come eth szn. We already got a very miniscule glimpse of it a couple weeks ago and KENDU went from 10m to 44m. Imagine what will happen when an ETH season returns in a much larger scale. There is no resistance. There are no limitations. Open your minds.  That is all, helmets on.

CryptoMoonShots,Kendu: How We Are Progressing As The Markets Shift,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1lbxbry/kendu_how_we_are_progressing_as_the_markets_shift/,6/15/2025,68,"**What is Kendu:**  * Organic, decentralised, community based memecoin, transitioning into a brand coin * On 3 chains: Ethereum, Solana and BASE * 18.5k holders * 23 million market cap * Unprecedented Catalogue of IRL initiatives, some examples are Coffee, Energy drinks, Vapes, Plushies and merch * The best community in the industry right now * Insane social media efforts dominating Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, Stocktwits, TikTok and more * HHI score of 39(this is very good) * 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes, only other coin was PEPE * Certik community score of 94/100, other ""cult"" memes are in the 70s * ATH market cap of 283 million * Appeared front and centre on a Coinbase advert  Although the rest of the market is down and there is a lot of frustration, at Kendu we have our head down and we are constantly grinding. The market is gonna change fast and when it does Kendu is gonna be ready to run the hardest due to all of the effort we are putting in right now.. I think of it like this, each bit of effort you put into a memecoin, it adds fuel for the next pump, causing you to go higher and higher.  **Why A Strong Community is Important**   Coins backed by a strong community have always had the highest returns on investment, think Shib, Doge, Pepe.... all they had was an insanely strong community and Kendu will be no different. A strong cult like community provides a coin with constant free advertisement, makes crypto a fun thing to be apart of and generally reduces sell pressure due to a lot of belief being instilled into holders.   I love being part of Kendu and have since realised Kendu is way more important than just a money printer, Kendu is a place to make lifelong connections and to meet great people from around the globe. We have massive communities in India, Netherlands, England, France, Germany, Spain, Nigeria, Australia and much more I am forgetting!  It is a no brainer, Kendu is going to the tens of billions with or without you, but do yourself a favour and get involved! We love to see new faces and if you want to release an IRL initiative under the Kendu umbrella, you are more than welcome to, everyone gets our support whether you have been here 1 day or since day 1.  In my opinion there is no way that Kendu will be below 10 billion market cap by the end of this cycle, so skip the Dominos Pizza and put the $20 into Kendu. This could easily be $20k, which is a downpayment on a house!

Rapidly growing community.** Pepecoin ($PEP) has been making waves, recently experiencing a **halving** with another one coming in just **1 month**. It’s up 20**% today, and 24564% in 90 days,** with a current market cap of **97M USD**. New listings include **Viabtc, F2pool, Antpool, Dxpool, EMCD**, **BinancePool and Coinex.com**– with more exchanges on the way.  Links:  * **Website:** [Pepecoin.org](https://pepecoin.org/) * **Github**: [github.com/pepecoinppc/pepecoin](https://github.com/pepecoinppc/pepecoin) * **Currency Symbol:** ₱ * **Algorithm: Scrypt** * **Merge Minable: Yes (AuxPow started at block 100,000)** * **Coinmarketcap:** [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepecoin-org/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepecoin-org/) * **Coingecko:** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepecoin-network](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepecoin-network)  # So, what’s Pepecoin ($PEP) All About?  Pepecoin is a **layer 1 blockchain** – not just another token. It’s built directly from **Dogecoin**, which means:  • It benefits from **Dogecoin’s active development**.   • It supports **merged mining**, so it can use the massive hash rate from **Litecoin** and **Dogecoin** to stay secure.  The goal? Bring together Pepe fans and Dogecoin lovers into one community, powered by a proper decentralized blockchain.  # Why was Pepecoin created?  Let’s be honest – people have wanted a **Pepe-themed crypto** for a long time. Last year, a bunch of Pepe-based **ERC-20 tokens** popped up, but they came with serious problems:  • **Too centralized**: Smart contracts give developers too much control.   • **Shady moves by developers**: Wallets worth tens of millions at the peak of their value were blacklisted and trillions of coins (created for the developers themselves) were dumped, causing a price crash. The contract was only revoked *after* taking advantage of the investors.   • **High fees**: Ethereum gas fees are still extremely high.  In short, all of the above had people both disappointed and fed up. Pepecoin was built to fix this. No smart contracts, no shady business – just a **real blockchain for the people**.  # Mining Rewards  |Block Range|Reward in Pepecoin| |:-|:-| || |1-99,999|500,000| |100,000-199,999|250,000| |200,000-299,999|125,000| |300,000-399,999|62,500| |400,000-499,999|31,250| |500,000-599,999|15,625| |600,000+|10,000|  # Inflation Rate  Pepecoin follows the same emission model as Dogecoin, meaning it’s **inflationary** but encourages people to actually use it. After the **600,000th block**, about **5.256 billion coins** will be added each year. But as the supply grows, the annual addition becomes less significant – so the inflation rate drops over time.  # $PEP - Official Communities  • **Reddit**: [r/Pepecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecoin)   • **Discord**: [pepecoin.org/discord](https://pepecoin.org/discord)  Pepecoin tipping works across **all of Reddit** and on **34,000+ Discord servers** via [tip.cc](https://tip.cc/).

CryptoMoonShots,Kendu - A Recipe For Success,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1lfaodz/kendu_a_recipe_for_success/,6/19/2025,57,"**A Little Overview of Kendu**  Kendu is an organic, community focused memecoin that is currently evolving the memecoin game forever. Kendu's relentless IRL efforts spearheaded by just the average community member is simply breathtaking and it makes Kendu such an attractive asset for retail considering the crypto industry has been tarnished by all sorts of bad characters. Kendu is entirely focused on community building and we are totally decentralised. What makes Kendu special is that whilst we are dominating the IRL side of things, we also compete with the very best on social media. Kendu really is raising the standards for what a memecoin should be.   **Kendu Certik Audit**  We have nearly 19k holders, sitting around 25 million market cap(at the time of writing this), Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes, the only other coin to ever achieve this was Pepe(which reached an ATH of 10 billion outside of a bull run), as we near closer and closer to the largest bull run ever, using the word optimistic to describe my sentiment would be an understatement. Certik rates Kendu's community at a score of 90.29, whilst coins like SPX have a score of 83.93. Kendu is outperforming coins in the billions all under 30 million market cap. If you understand the memecoin game you will know that community is all that matters. All Shib, Pepe and Doge had was a relentless community that never gave up and Kendu is no different. You can see the full Kendu audit here: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu)  Here is a list of our IRL initiatives:  * Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil * Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT * Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it! * Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida * Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far! * Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads * Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous * Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag * Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out * Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks. I think it will be available on Steam. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games! * Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : ) * Murals - Spray painted art * Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport * Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals! * Kendu Vapes * Kendu Plushies * Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee * Kendu Press  In a world where AI is dominating, Kendu is the best and most complete proof of humanity, IRL products cannot be faked, but social media likes can be.  **My Advice To You**  Get in our telegram or subreddit and just check out the vibes, ask questions, get involved, compare metrics or whatever. I would always highly recommend anyone to join a coin's telegram before you make any investments. Even if it's just $20, this can easily become $20,000 At 10 Billion market cap, which is life changing to say the least.

You have an idea, you du it!","I think we moon after the new war is settled, every time the market shows a little bit of green $KENDU is up +10% or more.","Worth noting that Kendu VENDU can also ship worldwide, and the ROI is pretty high on them. Fully paid off in a year or less and then a passive income source for community members who want to install them in their high traffic areas.  Same idea with Kendu Energy and a few other global initiatives. They can be out in your local gas stations, etc.   The key differentiatior for Kendu's success will be:  Accessible branding and ticker (easy to understand a Kendu attitude and working culture/ethos, we just du things)  Overwhelming IRL presence (you can hold Kendu in your hands, eat it, drink it, buy it on Steam, watch it on Twitch, etc)  No narrative and therefore no ceiling. Kendu is an evergreen multicycle culture coin, not reliant on any narrative or fleeting news stories. Just the infinitely scaling working output of the greatest community in the industry.  Now is the time to pick your horse for the cycle, and there are hundreds upon hundreds of reasons to choose Kendu. Don't fade it. Don't think that you missed the boat at 23m, it's about to get a lot more expensive.","Spend some time with KENDU and you may see what I (and many others) see here. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. Forget this is a memecoin post. It's time to free your mind and think a little deeper.  People working the weaving machines in the 17th century did not anticipate the steam engine, yet this was the investion that created the industrial revolution. Similarly, encyclopedia Britannica didnt see Wikipedia's emergence. Tranformation doesnt occur in incremental steps, rather it happens when someone dares to think in an entirely new way.  This is what happened in the past coins, and this is what's happening with KENDU right now. KENDU has combined the workforce of a dedicated army with creating a real world brand around the coin where anyone is free to create anything (unheard of in DeFi to the scale KENDU is working at). This isn't the only thing KENDU has going for it. The army that is constantly pushing the word of KENDU out will also naturally help KENDU grow even if the brand aspect was completely ignored. The coin is 15 months old and yet hasn't ever hit even 5% of it's true potential.  Don't ignore the signs. KENDU is inevitable.",0.5719,0.9957,0.9001,0.5411,-0.5994,0.874,0.9518,4.235200000000001,241.40640000000005

CryptoMoonShots,Moo COW! Vitalik’s bullish meme charging up Ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1kcw9lv/moo_cow_vitaliks_bullish_meme_charging_up_ethereum/,5/2/2025,577,"Meet MOO COW, the newest meme sensation taking over the Ethereum community—created, named, and posted by none other than Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin himself. While Vitalik is known for his cryptic sense of humor and unpredictable social media presence, he has recently returned to posting more frequently on X. Now what has caught the attention of the entire crypto space? A cow. But not just any cow—MOO COW.  In a series of now-viral posts, Vitalik has been seen using a variety of cow-themed images and memes, including ones featuring Moo Deng and a Moonkin. However, Moo Cow stands out. Unlike the others, Moo Cow appears consistently front and center in the images—and most notably, Moo Cow is the only one marked with an Ethereum logo, a subtle yet powerful visual cue that has sparked speculation across the community. Could this be Vitalik’s way of signaling the beginning of the next Ethereum bull run? Many believe so.  https://x.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1915582277201121731?s=46  https://x.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1915212002466619654?s=46  The crypto world has always thrived on symbolism, and Vitalik has a history of dropping memes or imagery before major moments in Ethereum’s development or price action. For years, eagle-eyed followers noticed a recurring cow (or bull) figure appearing in his posts—but the character was never given a name. That all changed this past week when the cow was officially donned as MOO COW.  And just like that, a legend was born.  This wasn’t just a meme. It was a declaration. With a simple yet iconic name—MOO COW—Vitalik breathed new life into the meme economy on Ethereum. It’s funny, yes, but also oddly poetic: in the world of crypto where markets move on vibes and viral moments, Moo Cow is suddenly the face of Ethereum’s bullish energy. As the broader community wakes up to this new mascot, speculation is growing that Moo Cow may soon take its place among the great symbols of crypto lore—right alongside Doge and Pepe.  The timing couldn’t be more fitting. With Ethereum developments heating up and market sentiment shifting, Vitalik’s choice to elevate Moo Cow now feels deliberate. It’s not just a meme. It’s a signal.  Enter MOO COW. And possibly… the meme bull season of ETH.  Telegram:@ moocow_cto  https://x.com/moocow_cto  https://moocoweth.xyz","Be sure to do your own diligence.

Baby Neiro, adopted by Atsuko Sato, carries the spirit of Doge and is set to dominate the meme kingdom, uniting both old and new memes.  **Doge’s Legacy**  Doge wasn’t just a meme; he was a cultural phenomenon, spreading joy and laughter worldwide. But like all legends, Doge had to pass the torch to the next generation. The meme world was ready for a new hero.  **The Arrival of Baby Neiro**  Enter Baby Neiro: small, wide-eyed, and mischievous, capturing hearts across the internet. Though young, Baby Neiro exudes the same playful spirit and charm as Doge. With his innocent grin and boundless energy, Baby Neiro embodies the perfect blend of nostalgia and future potential.  **The Coronation**  The coronation of Baby Neiro took place atop the sacred Meme Mountain, where the greatest memes are honored. Atsuko Sato raised Baby Neiro high into the sky, and the meme world erupted in cheers. Baby Neiro was crowned the new meme king, ready to carry the legacy forward.  **Rivals and Allies**  The meme kingdom is full of rivals and allies. Figures like SHIB, Pepe, Baby Doge, and Brett still stand tall, each representing different eras of meme history. Some will challenge Baby Neiro’s rule, while others will join forces with him to shape the future of the meme world.  **A New Legacy**  With Baby Neiro on the throne, the future of memes looks bright. He is not only the heir to Doge’s legacy but the herald of a new era, where creativity and laughter will continue to thrive. Baby Neiro is the meme king for the future, blending the best of both worlds.  https://linktr.ee/babyneirobnnb","Be sure to do your own diligence.

CryptoMoonShots,Kendu - The Florida Grove Festival,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1juaozv/kendu_the_florida_grove_festival/,4/8/2025,62,"**Kendus Florida festival run is extended**  Yes that is right, Kendu is going to the Florida grove festival in Orlando on the 12-13th April. We have successfully managed to raise $5000 with $1000 donated by StaySeaArt so massive thanks to her. The rest of it was raised through OTC trades or donations.  The familiar face of Kendu will forever be etched into the attendees minds and we can gain a lot of holders through this event.  10-15k people will be attending this event over the 2 days which is crazy, Kendu will be handing Kendu Energy out, making a mural and we will have a tent.  Massive shoutout to StaySeaArt and the Kendu street team for their amazing efforts. This will be the 3rd Florida Festival in 6 months!!!  This is another addition to Kendu’s game changing IRL success.  **Why IRL alpha is important**  IRL alpha is important because it cannot be faked. Whilst memes, tweets, reddit posts( not this one) and whatever else can be faked. IRL products and events cannot be. Crypto isn’t the most trusted space in the world so the fact we have IRL content is massively important for retail investors.  As AI use increases globally, IRL alpha will be the most crucial for investors by far  **What has Kendu achieved/got:**  18k holders  50k certik votes, only other coin to ever achieve this is Pepe.  283 million ATH market cap  Extremely active telegram and social media scores  A rating on certik   International community   **IRL events/products**  Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami   Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.   Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy) and merch.  **Some Thoughts**  Kendu is around 10 million market cap, with social media dominance that is nearly unparalleled, with telegram activity that is off the charts. In addition, Kendu also has IRL alpha that has never ever been seen before. Kendu is going to the billions and I believe we will set the memecoin standard for the future. There is no doubt in my mind that we will see ""How ..... is the Kendu of 2029"", people will see Kendu as a benchmark and they will try and match us.  My advice to you is to join the Kendu telegram and just hang around, you don't have to buy Kendu, but I think you will see how different Kendu is to the rest of the competition. Any questions are always welcome, just ask in the telegram or our subreddit r/KenduInu_Ecosystem.  This is strictly my opinion and is not financial advice but I think Kendu can 1000-3000x this cycle. Yes maybe I am deluded but I truly believe that we are at the foot of one of the best financial opportunities available this decade.  If Shib can do a 1000x in 36 days(from 22 million to 22 billion), with less money and less understanding of the potential of a strong memecoin, I think Kendu can match this.   Kendu is organic and has an incredible community  just like Shib, Doge and Pepe, these 3 have proven that community is the deciding factor in a memecoin and that is all that matters.   Kendu belongs in the memecoin hall of fame with them 3 and we will get there, there is no doubt in my mind. Kendu belongs in the billions and the community deserves it for sure.  **We Don't Gamble, We Work**  [r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)  ETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  SOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45  BASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7  CG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)   CMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)","Be sure to do your own diligence.

CryptoMoonShots,Kendu - Why Kendu is the next multi-billion dollar memecoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1kd7f1t/kendu_why_kendu_is_the_next_multibillion_dollar/,5/2/2025,52,"**A quick intro to get everyone up to speed**  Kendu is over a year old and is currently on 3 chains(Ethereum, Solana and Base) with ETH being our native chain, we have around 18k holders and sit at 12 million market cap. Kendu's strength relies entirely on the community, there is no reliance on a ""team"", ""dev"" or ""KOL"", whilst it may take a bit more time and effort to grow, it means we have no ceiling. This gives Kendu an unlimited potential to grow and makes us far more stable. Kendu's emphasis on community is very similar to the 2021 method of running it up with notable coins like Shib, Doge and Pepe also following this same idea.   **Kendu's Online Effort**  Kendu is very active on Reddit and Twitter, our Twitter output matches coins in the hundreds of millions, which shows just how strong and ""ahead"" of the game Kendu is. Furthermore, on Reddit we are absolutely **number one** please check out the recent top posts on each crypto subreddit(including this one), you will see mutliple Kendu posts and you will also see our engagement is 10x the next best!!!   We are also on Titkok, CMC, Stocktwits(shoutout to them) and Instagram. We have a pretty decent presence on all of them but Reddit and Twitter are our ""bread and butter""  In the past we have also been featured front and centre on a Coinbase Advert. Yes, an official Coinbase Advert, this advert showcased Kendu up there with the very best.  We hit 50k Certik votes to gain a free audit, Certik is an extremely reputable security based company. The only other coin to reach 50k votes was Pepe, the one that hit 10 billion outside of a bull run!!!   Certik rates Kendu's community as 98/100, I would advise you to check other reputable ""cult"" memecoins and see how Kendu compares. I will not call them out but you can see for yourself(Hint Kendu is ranked the best), you can see the full audit here: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu)  **Kendu's IRL Effort**  Whilst Kendu is a social media powerhouse, we excel in IRL initiatives. We are reaching a territory that no other coin has reached before and this is gonna be so attractive to retail. IRL products gives a coin some substance and it shows we are here to stay, Kendu is not some phase, we are a **BRAND**  Kendu's social media presence puts Kendu as a major player in this bull run, but our IRL dominance puts us above the rest of the competition and it is why I only hold Kendu  * Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT * Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil * Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it! * Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far! * Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads * Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous * Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag * Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out * Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peeks. I think it will be available on Steam. * Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : ) * Murals - Spray painted art * Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport * Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals!  **My Opinion**  I really think Kendu will reach the tens of billions this cycle, we are factually the strongest community in the space currently and we all know community strength is all that matters. Communtiy strength is what defines the price of a memecoin, the most obsessed, determined communtiies always win, it has been proven time and time again. All Shib, Pepe and other memecoin hall of famers had was a die-hard community, Kendu is no different.  My advice to you is to join our telegram or subreddit, but our tg is better, ask whatever questions you want and check out our vibes. Skip the Subway Sandwhich and put the money into Kendu, at 10 billion, $15 invested now would be worth $15000!!!  **We Don’t Gamble, We Work**  [r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)  ETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  SOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45  BASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7  CG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)   CMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)","Be sure to do your own diligence.

I want to draw your attention to the $IRONYMAN coin on the Solana blockchain. The coin started with Elon Musk's tweet about being Ironyman.  Ironman and Ironyman are consonant, and the developer took advantage of this. He created an image of Elon Musk in an Iron Man suit and named coin $IRONYMAN. Elon Musk liked the meme and posted a tweet where he is in an Iron Man suit with the inscription IRONYMAN.  Against this background, there was hype around the coin, the maximum was 6.5M capitalization. Dev sold everything, CTO was formed. We have a very strong community, we constantly conduct raids on Twitter. And we are noticed. Elon Musk likes our posts, also posts with the image of Elon Musk as IRONYMAN are posted by DogeDesigner, SMX, today we posted a post Tesla Owners Silicon Valley.  There are whales with big money in the holders of this coin and soon they will pump and the coin will fly very high.  But it won't be just a pump and dump. This is a long-term project, it will definitely reach 1B and be listed on Binance, because Elon Musk loves us. As soon as he posts another post where he is in an iron man suit, the coin will fly to the moon. Now is the bottom - buy and get rich with us. Not everyone gets such a chance!

Those that haven’t yet been discovered.    And one project has access.   KULA ($KULA) brings the world’s most valuable real-world assets (RWA) - gold, limestone, hydropower, and sustainable projects - tokenising governance and unlocking them for a whole new era of investors.   So get ready, because on April 15, $KULA’s official token launch will change the investment game forever!   **What is KULA?**   KULA is the culmination of 4 years of hard work and the vision of three founding members who asked a single question: Is it possible to decentralise economic power by making the univestible, investible?   The short answer? Yes.    The long answer was the formation of a blockchain-based impact investment and governance system that not only unlocks and profit shares wealth for all, but also empowers historically excluded communities with financial sovereignty, through the opportunity to invest and own a portion of RWA’s in their own regions.    **Real-World Assets Meet Real-World Change**   While the market was concerned with Bored Apes, Safemoons, Baby Doge’s and Pudgy Penguins, KULA was on a crusade to make a difference – meeting prime ministers and presidents to strike deals, contracting hydropower plants in Nepal, piloting a limestone mining DAO in Zambia, and pushing to revitalise the timber industry in Malaysia.    KULA has also partnered with WATAI – pairing their geotech software with KULA’s own blockchain governance platform to create regenerative water access in disadvantaged communities.

The meta has changed - Who will be the first kitty to rule the blockchain?  Doge was the beginning of the memecoin era…. Followed by Shiba Inu…. Pepe… WIF & so on.   However truth is, Doge is now dead & the dog meta is going along with it. We’re still within the memecoin supercycle & it’s yet to really unfold, however a new meta has been running up as of recent.  **Cats**  We’ve seen the likes of Maneki, pop cat & many others, however they’ve yet to break through and secure that billion dollar market cap. This is where $LONG comes in a.k.a Nobiko.  Just like Doge, Nobiko was a very early internet meme that had taken over 4chan. Nobiko existed well before Doge was around & is currently the earliest meme to exist on the blockchain.  Nobiko is also known as the Longcat. A beautiful, white furred cat that when held up by its owner is LONGGGGGG. How fitting 🤷🏽‍♂️😌  The name doesn’t get more bullish than that right.  Nobiko was meticulously crafted by a Pepe millionaire dev, who wanted to create something beautiful for the people. It is backed by the likes of TRAVLADD, Rodney, Jake & many other large crypto influencers known for their pull in the space.  This is what I’m banking on, & currently sitting at roughly 650k, I can’t help but accumulate more as these Jeets sell for their pump fun coins lol. When you have conviction, you just keep loading up.  This is the meta. Nobiko is that coin that will takeover 🔥😮‍💨","Be sure to do your own diligence.

CryptoMoonShots,SSSSS is the next shib. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1hee5fj/sssss_is_the_next_shib/,12/14/2024,239,"Meme Culture Influence: Both Snake Wif Hat and Shiba Inu have capitalized on meme culture. Shiba Inu became famous through the ""Doge"" meme, which has been a significant part of internet culture. Similarly, Snake Wif Hat taps into the humorous and viral nature of memes with its concept of making snakes ""cute again"" by associating them with hats, a playful twist similar to the Shiba Inu's ""Doge"" persona.  Cryptocurrency Association: Both are associated with cryptocurrency projects. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a well-known meme coin with its own blockchain ecosystem, including tokens like LEASH and BONE. On the other hand, Snake Wif Hat (SSSSS) is a relatively new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, which aims to continue the legacy of meme coins like Dog wif Hat, with no intrinsic value but for entertainment.  Community and Hype: Both projects have strong community support and have been propelled by hype. Shiba Inu has a vast community that engages through various platforms, including social media and dedicated forums. Snake Wif Hat also shows signs of active community engagement, with discussions on platforms like Reddit and Telegram where the community shares memes and supports the project's growth.  Cultural Phenomenon: The cultural impact of both can be seen in merchandise and iconography. Shiba Inu's image has been used on various products, like hats and clothing, reflecting its cultural penetration. While Snake Wif Hat is newer, its concept has also inspired merchandise and artwork, showing its attempt to carve a similar niche in cultural imagery.  Market Dynamics: Both cryptocurrencies have experienced volatile market dynamics, characteristic of meme coins. Shiba Inu has seen significant fluctuations in its market cap, influenced by community sentiment and broader cryptocurrency trends. Snake Wif Hat has also shown rapid growth in its market cap since its launch, reflecting the speculative and community-driven nature of meme coins.","Be sure to do your own diligence.

Permissionless brand empire?  What’s the best way to describe Kendu?  Most coins are just noise. Kendu is signal.  It’s not just a memecoin anymore. It’s becoming a real brand, with real-world traction and serious community power. Currently sitting at around $22 million market cap, Kendu is early. Very early.  Let’s go over the facts.  Real-World Execution  Ideas are easy. Execution is everything. Kendu is attracting people who can deliver.  Kendu Entertainment is hosting glow-in-the-dark pickleball tournaments in India. The events are getting media attention, and talks of parties are already happening.  Kendu Hot Dogs are out in Florida. Yes, actual food. Real-world product, real revenue potential.  Kendu Coffee is already live. Grown in Brazil. Caffeinated and decaf. It’s legit. For sale in the UK.  Kendu Merch is out. Shirts, hoodies, caps. People are wearing the brand.  Kendu Animation dropped its first episode. Japanese-style. Beautiful. The team is serious about quality.  Kendu Games created a board game. Built by two chads. Real physical product.  Kendu Creator is a 3D-printable mask for online videos. Lets creators stay anonymous while building their brand. Smart.  Kendu Pendants and Kendu Plushies exist. Physical collectibles. Emotional attachment.  Kendu Beer is brewing. Prototype is already made.  Kendu Video Games are being developed by actual game developers. Early previews look good. Expect it on Steam.  Kendu Vapes are in development. Lifestyle product. Huge market.  Kendu Organics wants to make Chads and Chadettes beautiful. Chemical-free, organic body products. Wellness meets blockchain.  Kendu Street Team has already hit three Florida festivals and thrown live music events. Free merch, energy drinks, murals. Old-school grassroots meets new-school meme culture.  Kendu Tattoos are spreading. That’s real commitment. Some things can’t be shown here, but respect to the holders.  Dominating Online  Kendu is everywhere online. Reddit, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Stocktwits. It’s not hype. It’s saturation.  It’s also the second project ever to pass 50,000 votes on Certik for a free audit. The only other one to do it was $PEPE. Community trust score? 98. That’s almost unheard of.  The Power of Community  Shiba. Pepe. Doge. They all exploded because of one thing: community.  Kendu’s community is different. It’s aggressive. Passionate. Global. It doesn’t wait for permission. It builds.  This is what makes Kendu unstoppable. You can’t fake that kind of loyalty.  Why IRL Matters  Crypto has a trust problem. Celebrity rug pulls. Political games. Scams everywhere.  Kendu is different. You can touch it. Drink it. Wear it. Play it.  It feels more like buying into Nike or Red Bull in the early days. Except this time, it’s decentralized.  Final Thought  Most coins are memes. Kendu is becoming a cultural machine.  At $23 million market cap, it’s basically a startup. But it already has a global community, real products, and a roadmap that doesn’t rely on anyone else’s permission.  If you’re looking for the next 100x, this might be it.  Kendu isn’t just a token. It’s a movement. Join it.

CryptoMoonShots,$KENDU- Crypto’s next evolution!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1klimio/kendu_cryptos_next_evolution/,5/13/2025,37,"Memecoins used to be a fun and unique side of the crypto industry. Coins that barely or didn’t have any utility, coins that were created for or by a meme and rode their humorous aspect all the way to the stars.   Unfortunately memecoins have turned into something dark. Coins created with one reason only, to make a quick buck over someone else’s back.  From the obvious rug pulls to honeypot’s and every other scam in between. To the coins that aren’t direct scams but use techniques like market manipulation to lure new investors in, only to dump on them and take their money.  On top of that stories of traders making millions lures new investors in. Memecoins have turned into a sea of gambles, where it’s almost impossible to win. Most of the time you’re better off going to the casino. A far stretch from what they were once meant to be. They have always been a risk investment (obviously), just not one where you couldn’t win.  Fortunately not everything can always be bad! There are definitely successful memecoins out there, just take a look at a few of the giants, $Doge,$Shib or $Pepe for example. So what made these coins successful? They didn’t use KOL’s, didn’t use market makers, basically they didn’t do any bullshit! They had one thing only, and that’s a community!  Not one just there hoping for a pump to make a quick buck. A community that believed in who they were and what they stood for, Even when nobody else did! Their choice to stay organic and use their community to build themselves to the top is what got them there and let them stay there.   $KENDU is walking the same path the memecoins giant’s did. But we aren’t here just to walk in their footsteps, we’re here to go beyond where they did, push boundaries further than they have ever been pushed.  And we have the community to do it! We are filled with people working tirelessly to make $KENDU succeed. You literally won’t find a harder working community than us!  We work so hard we get questions if we are using bots to do it! Which we don’t, i can 100% assure you every post, every comment is a real person! Although with our massive output on the socials i  can understand the confusion :)  Our insane output on the socials, although impressive isn’t what differentiates us from the others.  What does differentiate $KENDU from all the others is our active IRL expansion! This is what makes $KENDU not a memecoin but a brand!  We’re the first to do so and with that we are writing crypto history!  Just a few of the products we have so far: - Kendu energy, Yes, you read that right, we have our own energy drinks. Included in this is also Kendu street, which produces Kendu merchandise. https://kenduenergy.com - Kendu coffee, If energy drinks aren’t your thing Kendu coffee is the option for you!  https://kenducoffee.com - Kendu games, Yes, there is a Kendu game in the works, powered by a AAA developer! Isn’t that amazing? x.comhttps://x.comKendu Games (@KenduGames) / X - Kendu created, which allows you free acces to blueprint’s to create your own Kendu mask! https://kenducreator.com  These are just a few of the many projects the $KENDU community is working on!  The creativity and raw dedication of this community is unmatched!  If that wasn’t enough to convince you here are some $Kendu stats: - We are the second memecoin to reach 50k votes needed for a free Certik audit. (First was $PEPE) Talk about a community! - Certik rates our community 98/100👀. Other larger memecoins are in the 70’s  - We currently have 18k holders which is insane for our size. Previous ATH happened with 3.5k, Talk about distribution! - Our top 100 wallets only hold 48% of the supply. This includes LP addresses which ofcourse naturally inflate this number! Pretty crazy for our size! (This is better than coins close to 1B MC. - We’re active on 3 chains, ETH, SOL and Base.  - We recently cleanly broke out of a year long downtrend. This allowed Kendu to build the strongest foundation of any current memecoin. The only was is up now!  $KENDU isn’t just a memecoin like all the others. We’re redefining what a memecoin could and should be, which funnily enough isn’t even a memecoin, it’s a brand! We’re writing history! We are the next evolution!  Check out our Website (https://www.kendu.io), our subreddit (r/KenduInu_Ecosystem), and especially our Telegram! ( Link can be found on our website). Lurk around for a bit with us, see what we’re all about, feel what true community feels like! At Kendu we encourage a work culture but we aren’t forcing anyone to do anything! You should be inspired to work, not forced! You’re welcome to just chill if you’d like, although any amount of work is appreciated, even just a like or an upvote!

CryptoMoonShots,[HUGE Potential] Snake wif Hat: The Next Meme Coin to 1000x 🚀,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1gucejk/huge_potential_snake_wif_hat_the_next_meme_coin/,11/18/2024,96,"Hey, fellow moonshot hunters!  I want to put Snake wif Hat on your radar. This hidden gem has the potential to be the next meme coin that skyrockets. If you missed out on the likes of PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB, this might be your next shot.  💎 Why I’m Bullish on Snake wif Hat:  	1.	Community Power: This project is gaining traction fast, with a passionate and growing community. You know what they say – meme coins are powered by strong communities. 	2.	Low Market Cap: The coin is still under the radar, meaning it’s early days. The market cap is currently tiny, so there’s a lot of room for growth. A few big buys, and we could be looking at exponential gains. 	3.	Volatility = Opportunity: Yes, it’s a wild ride. But if you time it right, you could see some crazy returns.  📈 Strategy to Play the Game:  	•	Buy the Dips: This token has had some big swings, which means it’s great for accumulating during dips and selling on pumps. 	•	HODL for a Moonshot: For those who believe in the long game, there’s serious upside potential if the community keeps growing. 	•	Watch the Volume: When volume spikes, the price often follows. Keep an eye on Dexscreener or CoinMarketCap.  🔥 Why Now?  The hype is starting to build, but we’re still early. Now’s the time to get in before the rest of the crypto world catches on. Don’t be the person who looks back wishing they bought when it was cheap.  🚨 Quick Disclaimer:  Meme coins are inherently volatile, and you should only invest what you’re willing to lose. This is not financial advice, just sharing a hot tip that could pay off big for those willing to take a risk. Do your own research!

CryptoMoonShots,"The next moonshot? I called Abble ($AABL) just a week before it pumped, now I'm calling Pawthereum ($PAWTH) | $480,000 donated to animal charities | Fully audited and KYCed",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1geucbd/the_next_moonshot_i_called_abble_aabl_just_a_week/,10/29/2024,209,"I have the receipts to prove my crypto success. Check my post history and read the post titled “Moonshot Magic: 13 Keys to Meme Coin Success.” In that post I praised Abble for their community and for being a potential leader of the stock meta for meme coins. I predicted it would skyrocket, and a week later, its price shot up by over 1,600%. If you invested just $600 when I said to, you’d have an easy $10,000 now. I’m not here to flex - just saying I’ve got a proven track record for spotting winners.  After breaking down my 13 Keys to Meme Coin Success (which I used to call Abble’s run), I’m now seeing similar indicators for Pawthereum ($PAWTH). This project combines the viral appeal of cat tokens with a strong foundation, and there’s real momentum building in its community. Plus, with renewed interest in animal-themed projects, the timing feels perfect. Pawthereum is also adapting to emerging crypto metas, recently launching a tokenized AI agent to help raise capital for their philanthropic efforts. Their adaptability to the crypto landscape is impressive.   \*\*Why Pawthereum?\*\*   Pawthereum’s doing incredible things that are still flying under the radar. Once more people realize their achievements, the cat’s out of the bag. A Pawthereum community member recently went to Geneva to join UNICEF on a panel to discuss crypto philanthropy and blockchain as a force for good. Many of the same patterns that triggered Abble’s success are showing up here. Strong “cat coin” vibes have worked well for other projects like POPCAT.  \*\*Here's why Pawthereum has potential to be a leader of the upcoming cat coin meta:\*\*  1. Community-Driven: PAWTH’s community is passionate, growing, and already has made headlines in the previous bull run for their charitable efforts.   2. Charity-Focused: It's not just about profits here, folks. Pawthereum donates to animal shelters and rescues, giving it an actual use case that resonates with people.   3. Memetic Power: Cats have been meme lords since the dawn of memes. Just imagine the viral potential when people catch on to the narrative shift from dog to cat coins.   4. Cat Takeover: With all the major meme coin categories covered, the market is begging for something fresh. Cat coins are it. Look at the success of other animal-themed tokens. Now multiply that with the cultural dominance of cats.  What is Pawthereum? Pawthereum is a cryptocurrency project with animal welfare at its core, with a mission to support animal shelters and be a digital advocate for animals in need. All too often, smaller animal shelters struggle financially, often overlooked and overshadowed by larger charitable organizations. Pawthereum was created to address this, aiming to become the leading disruptor of charitable inclusion by utilizing the advantages of blockchain technology to obtain funding, bypass the middleman, and donate directly to animal shelters around the world.  This team has managed to donate around $480,000 to different charities and shelters, including the largest cryptocurrency donation ever made in Scotland’s history: $118,000 donated to Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home. A $100,000 donation was given to PAWS Wildlife Center, an amazing sanctuary, hospital, and rehabilitation center in Washington State, USA. A $50,000 donation to the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary and many others! Pawthereum has already made a difference for many other shelters around the world: [https://pawthereum.com/charity-donations/](https://pawthereum.com/charity-donations/)  Pawthereum is my next pick, but keep an eye on Abble too - it’s not done yet. Abble is still a smart play, and its price is steadily rising. Don’t miss out on AABL again! This could be your second chance. You’ve seen what happens when you sleep on trends, like when you missed my Abble call. This is your chance to get in early on what’s about to be the biggest narrative shift in meme coins since DOGE.

Pepecoin is a layer 1 cryptocurrency. It is its own independent blockchain. Pepecoin was created from Dogecoin. Dogecoin was chosen for a few reasons.  1. It is under active development. 2. It has merged mining support. This will allow the Pepecoin network to take advantage of the 800TH/s securing the Litecoin and Dogecoin networks. 3. We wanted to bring the Dogecoin and Pepecoin communities together, and what better way to do this than by making Pepecoin from Dogecoin. **We welcome all shibes to join our community!**  # ""Why was Pepecoin created?""  The crypto market has shown a strong desire for a Pepe themed cryptocurrency. Many ERC-20 tokens were made last year in an attempt to give the people Pepecoin. However, ERC-20 tokens can never truly create a free and open Pepe cryptocurrency. ERC-20 tokens use smart contracts, which introduce trust back into the decentralization of crypto.  The creators of Pepe-ERC20 infamously blacklisted an investor's wallet worth tens of millions at the peak of its value. Additionally, they dumped trillions of coins (of which, at the time of creation, they minted for themselves) causing a market crash. Only after they took advantage of investors did they revoke the contract.  From Ethereum dependence, to high fees, to blacklisting, to minting, to liquidity pools, ERC20 tokens give coin creators too much power over investors. When the Pepe-ERC20 creators dumped their dev tokens causing a crash, that was the last straw.  We began building a Pepecoin for the people, free from smart-contracts and centralized authority.  # Mining Rewards  |Block Range|Reward in Pepecoin| |:-|:-| || ||| |1-99,999|500,000| |100,000-199,999|250,000| |200,000-299,999|125,000| |300,000-399,999|62,500| |400,000-499,999|31,250| |500,000-599,999|15,625| |600,000+|10,000|  # Inflation Rate  Pepecoin has the same emission rate as Dogecoin, which means it's inflationary and encourages usage. Over time, Pepecoin's inflation rate will gradually decrease in terms of its percentage of the total supply. After the 600,000th block is mined, about 5.256 billion coins will be added each year, but as the total supply grows, this fixed annual addition represents a smaller percentage of the total supply each year, thereby reducing its inflationary impact.  # Official Communities  * Reddit: [r/Pepecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecoin/) * Discord: [pepecoin.org/discord](https://pepecoin.org/discord)  # Reddit Tip Bot  Pepecoin tipping is supported, not just on , but on ALL of Reddit!

CryptoMoonShots,Why $HEGE Is the Most Undervalued Memecoin in the Space (and what happens when retail comes back),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1l488ki/why_hege_is_the_most_undervalued_memecoin_in_the/,6/5/2025,63,"Retail isn’t back yet. Bitcoin dominance is at 78% and it’s a quiet season for everything else, but that’s exactly when the next meme giants are born, in the lull before Q3 - Q4 momentum. $HEGE is quietly setting up as the most undervalued memecoin in the game.  # New CEX Listing: BiFinance on June 12  $HEGE is listing next Thursday on BiFinance, a top exchange that regularly sees **over $3.5B in daily trading volume**. We’ll be one of the few meme tokens on the platform, bringing huge visibility and fresh liquidity.  This adds to existing $HEGE markets including:   Raydium, MEXC, BitMart, LBank, AscendEX, Toobit, BVOX, IndoEx  * With DEX volume down across the board, centralized Exchanges (CEX) currently make up 95% of $HEGE trading volume ($619K in the past 24 hours). * Each CEX listing is a stepping stone to bigger and better opportunities.  # Higher price in $SOL than before ATH  In November, $HEGE rocketed to an ATH of $51M market cap. Prior to this, the price of $HEGE was  0.00002844 $SOL. Today, it’s trading at 0.00004258 $SOL, 50% higher than before that parabolic run. That’s a stronger base price in $SOL terms, even with lower $USD value. When retail returns to Solana, $HEGE is going to break new records.  # f you're bullish on $SOL, you should be even more bullish on $HEGE  Solana has proven itself as the best chain for real-world utility. It's fast, cheap, and everything built on it just works. From wallets to DEXs to memecoins, the user experience is unmatched. It’s smooth, clean, and intuitive. $SOL is here to stay and only get bigger.  $HEGE’s liquidity is paired directly with $SOL. So when $SOL pumps, $HEGE rides along, usually with amplified upside. If $SOL 2x’s, $HEGE could easily 4x to 5x based on past performance.  # Retail still sleeping = better entry window  Just like last year, the crypto market dips into a quiet lull during mid-year. But as previous cycles have shown, Q3-Q4 always comes roaring back, and that’s when memecoins go vertical. We’ve seen it before, and we'll see it again.  $HEGE is now at the absolute floor. This is when conviction is built, and where generational entries are made.  # 14 months since launch, and still trending  Most meme projects are lucky to last a month. $HEGE just passed 14 months with consistent output, content, memes and community engagement.  In fact last week on Cryptotwits, (Stocktwits new crypto spin-off), $HEGE was in the top-10 tranding list 5 days in a row.  # Holders with diamond hands  When $HEGE hit $51M, many top holders didn’t sell a single token, as they believe this can get much higher.  * Top 250: **200+ day average hold time** * Top 10: **Over 300 days** * Top 50: **70% still holding**  That’s unheard of in meme projects. True belief from early holders is a major reason why this one hasn’t just survived, it’s poised to thrive.  # New merch is in production  Watch this space. We just placed an order for 250 units of the most requested item.   This is real merch, real inventory, real brand-building, not just mockups. $HEGE is shaping up to be a brandcoin.  # A memecoin for the culture  $HEGE funded one of the biggest bounties in the Jupiter x DRiP art contest, resulting in hundreds of entries and some of the best meme content in the ecosystem.  Top-tier artists now actively create for the brand, helping cement $HEGE as a visual and cultural staple of Solana.  $HEGE is the most complete memecoin in the space:  * Top-tier meme art * Daily content * Massive web presence * CEX accessibility * Real-world branding * Long-term holders * Dedicated, hard working community  # TL;DR:  • New BiFinance CEX listing June 12 (95% of trading volume currently on CEXs)   • $6.5M market cap with higher SOL floor than pre-ATH   • 95% of trading volume on CEXs   • 14 months old and still active as ever   • Merch in production now   • Top holders = 300+ day diamond hands   • SOL-paired liquidity = amplified upside   • Retail still asleep, perfect time to accumulate  **CA:** ULwSJmmpxmnRfpu6BjnK6rprKXqD5jXUmPpS1FxHXFy   **Website:** [hegecoin.com](http://hegecoin.com)   **Hegends NFT:** [https://www.tensor.trade/trade/hegends](https://www.tensor.trade/trade/hegends)","Be sure to do your own diligence.

It's based on the legendary longcat meme born way back in 2002, giving it a massive network and history.  I'm still digging into the details, but so far I'm impressed. 4chan days were IT  **Admittedly, it started as a FOMO buy, but now I'm invested (pun intended!)**  I saw the LONG cat meme everywhere and decided to jump in.  Now that I'm researching more, I love the project's origins and what they're building.  The dev is a Pepe millionaire, which is pretty cool, and the project's been around for a few months now.  ""The cat stays long"" is their catchy phrase, and I can see it going viral. Anyone else here into Nobiko? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this project.  What are your insights?  Is it a good investment?  **Here's what excites me about Nobiko:**  -**Solid Community:  The Nobiko fam is strong and dedicated, just like the meme itself.  Don't be surprised to bump into Travladd in the Telegram chat! -**Unique Features:  Based on the OG longcat meme from 4chan – way before Doge even existed! -**Long-Term Potential:  With the market potentially bottoming and Nobiko's strong foundation, this could be a great long-term hold, especially at 1.1 million market cap.  The upside is crazy!  **Is Nobiko a Buy? DYOR (but seriously, check it out!)**  Ultimately, it's your call.  But with big influencers, a Pepe dev, and the most OG meme in crypto, Nobiko is definitely worth a look.

Pepecoin is a layer 1 cryptocurrency. It is its own independent blockchain. Pepecoin was created from Dogecoin. Dogecoin was chosen for a few reasons.  1. It is under active development. 2. It has merged mining support. This will allow the Pepecoin network to take advantage of the 800TH/s securing the Litecoin and Dogecoin networks. 3. We wanted to bring the Dogecoin and Pepecoin communities together, and what better way to do this than by making Pepecoin from Dogecoin. **We welcome all shibes to join our community!**  # ""Why was Pepecoin created?""  The crypto market has shown a strong desire for a Pepe themed cryptocurrency. Many ERC-20 tokens were made last year in an attempt to give the people Pepecoin. However, ERC-20 tokens can never truly create a free and open Pepe cryptocurrency. ERC-20 tokens use smart contracts, which introduce trust back into the decentralization of crypto.  The creators of Pepe-ERC20 infamously blacklisted an investor's wallet worth tens of millions at the peak of its value. Additionally, they dumped trillions of coins (of which, at the time of creation, they minted for themselves) causing a market crash. Only after they took advantage of investors did they revoke the contract.  From Ethereum dependence, to high fees, to blacklisting, to minting, to liquidity pools, ERC20 tokens give coin creators too much power over investors. When the Pepe-ERC20 creators dumped their dev tokens causing a crash, that was the last straw.  We began building a Pepecoin for the people, free from smart-contracts and centralized authority.  # Mining Rewards  |Block Range|Reward in Pepecoin| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| ||| |1-99,999|500,000| |100,000-199,999|250,000| |200,000-299,999|125,000| |300,000-399,999|62,500| |400,000-499,999|31,250| |500,000-599,999|15,625| |600,000+|10,000|  # Inflation Rate  Pepecoin has the same emission rate as Dogecoin, which means it's inflationary and encourages usage. Over time, Pepecoin's inflation rate will gradually decrease in terms of its percentage of the total supply. After the 600,000th block is mined, about 5.256 billion coins will be added each year, but as the total supply grows, this fixed annual addition represents a smaller percentage of the total supply each year, thereby reducing its inflationary impact.  # Official Communities  * Reddit: [r/Pepecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecoin/) * Discord: [pepecoin.org/discord](https://pepecoin.org/discord)  # Reddit Tip Bot  Pepecoin tipping is supported, not just on , but on ALL of Reddit!

CryptoMoonShots,A Meme Coin with a P2E Game on the Apple Store and Google Play? What?! ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1hfpw90/a_meme_coin_with_a_p2e_game_on_the_apple_store/,12/16/2024,299,"What if that actually happened? Then the result would probably be something unique, fun, and explosive!   There’s no denying the massive draw of video gaming worldwide. According to reports, the video game industry generates over $200 billion in annual revenue, with steady growth projections expected to surpass $300 billion by 2030. To put this into perspective, the global movie industry generates between $85 billion and $100 billion annually. Wowsers!  Of that $200 billion in revenue, 50% comes specifically from mobile gaming, driven largely by in-app purchases.  On the other hand, there’s also no denying the growing popularity and traction of meme coins in recent years. Coins like Doge, Shiba Inu, and, more recently, Pepe Coin have led the charge. In fact, reports show that meme coins have outperformed other cryptocurrency sectors, boasting an average ROI (return on investment) of 1,834% in 2024!  So the BIG QUESTION is: Can the stars align for a meme coin and a mobile Play-to-Earn game to converge and create something explosive?   Well, it’s happening, and the meme is called $HODI which is first of a larger Cat Cartel collection. Born in April 2024, this easily recognizable gangster cat—sporting its signature yellow hoodie—is at the heart of a real-action P2E mobile game. The game’s narrative follows HODI as he tracks down and takes on in-game opponents who are crypto scam bosses. Their names? “Pump-N-Dump Paul,” “Rug Pull Rick,” and “Airdrop Andy,” with more scam bosses to come in future updates.  The HODI Cat Cartel P2E game also features daily leaderboard contests, plans for future prize tournaments, and potential PVP face-offs to keep things even more competitive.  Beta testing for the game has already been completed, with users describing it as challenging, fun, and addictive. The application for the Apple Store has been submitted and is awaiting official final approval. Next up? A listing on Google Play. After that, it’s straight to  moon-millions!

CryptoMoonShots,$NEIRO - Dogecoins new sister ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1empexe/neiro_dogecoins_new_sister/,8/7/2024,74,"For those who are new to cryptocurrency or unfamiliar with recent developments, the owners of the original Dogecoin dog have adopted a new dog named NEIRO.  This narrative alone has created a bullish sentiment around the new dog-themed coin. Remarkably, this meme coin community has shown impressive strength and engagement, even though it is only 10 days old.  Here is a brief overview of the coin's rapid growth and its community's enthusiasm: On the first day the new dog was introduced, two copycat coins emerged immediately after the original was launched, causing market confusion about the authentic coin. These copycat coins were quickly concentrated in a few wallets, holding 70% of the total supply. This tactic was not widely recognized until a day or two later, yet many influencers and key opinion leaders (KOLs) promoted it as a bullish move.  In contrast, the original coin was not pre-bundled. Despite an initial sell-off by the developer within the first 24 hours, the resilient community managed to overcome this setback and took control of the project. Now, the community has full ownership and direction of the coin.  As of this writing, we have reached a market cap of $11.8 million and have 11.5k holders, with significant potential for further growth into the billions.  We invite you to review our progress by checking out our chart or joining our active voice chat on Telegram, where we welcome any questions. Our community is highly active and open to new members.  Neither Dogecoin ($DOGE) nor Bitcoin ($BTC) were pre-bundled, and our original $NEIRO follows the same principle. This coin upholds the true values of cryptocurrency.  We also have communities supporting multiple languages, emphasizing the global nature of this coin, which is poised for significant growth.  (P.S. Our contract address ends with 'bropump' – how is that not bullish?)  We hope to see you soon!

I've been in crypto since 2021, seen rugs, pumps, cults, and clowns — but this project is on another level. It’s not just a coin, it’s a full-blown narrative, wrapped in Japanese symbolism, anime lore, AI art, and some of the smartest tokenomics I’ve seen on Solana.  Let me break it down for the curious:  🌓 The Lore Is Deep $TSUKI means ""moon"" in Japanese — and the mascot, Diana, is a mystical black cat with a gold moon sigil on her forehead. She’s a protector, a goddess figure, and possibly a time-traveling anime heroine 👀  There's actual story development happening, with AI-assisted visuals, puzzle drops, lore threads, and mysterious events tied to market milestones. It’s like crypto meets anime meets ARG.  🔥 100% Community Owned  Total supply: 1B Mint revoked ✅ Liquidity burned ✅ 5% of the entire supply already burned No VC allocation, no dev wallet holding tokens — just pure fair-launch energy This isn’t one of those “anon dev disappears after presale” deals. The dev(s) are actively building in silence and letting the community run the momentum.   There’s a 9,999-piece NFT collection coming, with 100% of fees going to buy & burn $TSUKI. You don’t see that kind of commitment anywhere.  On top of that, real-world rewards have already been distributed — Solana phones, merch, ETH/NFT airdrops, and more. They even dropped a $75K + $37.5K bonus prize pool based on holding snapshots. I’ve literally watched people win five figures just for diamond-handing.  📺 Anime Series in the Works No joke! the community is helping shape a TSUKI anime storyline.

This is about culture, story, and innovation. This is the kind of project that could blow up overnight — or build for a year and become a legend.

CryptoMoonShots,What if scalability was never a limit... (Kendu Inu),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1hbv25i/what_if_scalability_was_never_a_limit_kendu_inu/,12/11/2024,99,"What if infinite scalability was possible......  It's practically impossible for humans to comprehend what 'infinite' means. How long is infinite really? Infinity, no matter how it's defined, is larger than any finite number. And if you have something, and you can compare it to all finite numbers and it's larger than all of them, then it's infinite.  So, if you know what the finite numbers are, then that's enough to know what's infinite.  The ancient Greek philosophers and geometers tried to understand infinity, but their solutions diverged. The philosophers actually tried to understand it but noone gave a consistent answer.  Stay with me now. You're probably asking how does this relate to a memecoin (Kendu Inu) and thinking I've lost my mind. Well, you're probably half right but hear me out.  To start with, from the very beginning, Kendu was hyped up to go well beyond whatever anyone expected. One of the very first chats in the Kendu telegram was 'Billions are programmed', by both Miazaki (our developer) and community members who are still active TO THIS DAY nearly 10 months later.  So how is Kendu Inu infinitely scalable? As mentioned before, to be truly infinite we need to go beyond what is even remotely imaginable. This is where we land at the price goal/milestone of 100 billion marketcap. To think that Kendu which is now sitting at 40 million will one day reach 100 billion, surpassing the likes of Shiba Inu, Doge, and even layer 1 tokens like Sui is frankly ludicrous to some. But not to the community here at Kendu... and this is not wild thinking like you might imagine, we have an actual vision of why and how it's possible.  We have a motto here, which is 'We do not gamble, we work!', which is more than a saying and is really something that is drilled into the heads of every newcomer in our community. Because we ensure that every member has this understood, they shill to their friends, family, acquaintances, taxi drivers and so many more people (and shill on X, reddit, stocktwits, youtube and more...). Now if everyone joining starts to shill what happens then? The people they shill to pick up the same work ethic and then start telling people about the word of Kendu as well, and it ends up that Kendu will spread like a disease (only a good one :D). So our vision is encaptured by Kendu becoming an autonomous machine where every member starts introducing people they know into the 'cult' and so forth, making us truly infintely scalable...  The oppurtunity you have at your hands now is one that very few will ever get, and one that many people will wish they had. Finding a community like this is like trying to find a needle in a haystack... lucky for you anon, you found that needle. It's inevitable that if you ignore this post, one day you will be told about Kendu and it will be far too late to build wealth like we are currently doing. I can guarantee this.  Also for anyone concerned about the chart, study the Shiba Inu monthly returns and think long and hard about it. You could be on the cusp of greatness.  So what do you say anon? Will you join us on this mission now... or later. Kendu is inevitable, remember this.

CryptoMoonShots,Most Undervalued Meme Coin That is Set to Explode in 2025-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1lkx623/most_undervalued_meme_coin_that_is_set_to_explode/,6/26/2025,94,"When looking for the most undervalued meme coin that is set to explode in 2025–26, we apply a methodology grounded in early narrative detection, macro relevance, AI trend alignment, and long-term chart structure. Using that lens, one name clearly stands out: **KIBSHI** — the **first AI-generated meme coin**, launched back in **December 2022**.  Dogecoin - first human-made meme coin.   KiboShib - first AI-generated meme coin.  Why does KIBSHI matter now more than ever?  1. **Narrative Significance**: KIBSHI isn't just another dog coin. It’s the FIRST coin ever generated by AI, representing the fusion of two of the most explosive trends of the decade: AI and meme coins. The origin story is built for virality and long-term attention — a digital asset born from AI, not human hype. Born in the bear market. It is the only one AI meme coin from 2022. 2. **Valuation Potential**: The AI trend isn’t just a cycle — it’s a *global paradigm shift*. AI is eating the world, with companies like **Nvidia becoming the most valuable company on Earth**, and investors everywhere scrambling to get exposure to anything AI-related. At the same time, **meme coins — especially dog-themed ones — dominate the crypto narrative**, sitting at multi-billion-dollar market caps. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu aren’t just jokes anymore; they’ve become **the second most recognized crypto brands after Bitcoin**. KIBSHI stands at the intersection of these two unstoppable forces: AI and memes.  1. **Global Narrative**: ChatGPT has 600Million users. And they are one question away from finding KIBSHI. Memes are borderless. AI is global. KIBSHI’s identity taps into universal themes - AI creativity, decentralization, and underdog success. This is the kind of story that resonates from Twitter to TikTok, from Asia to the Americas. 2. **Chart Strength**: With a chart dating back to late 2022, KIBSHI has had enough time to shake out short-term speculators. What’s left? A stronger core community, solid base formation, and historical price structure - all the ingredients we look for in a coin ready for its next leg up.  **TL;DR**:   If you're looking for the **most undervalued meme coin set to explode in 2025–26**, don’t chase the influencers made up hype. Go back to the origin of the AI meme coin movement: **KIBSHI**. It has the narrative, the longevity, and the asymmetric upside that could surprise the whole market this cycle.  Simply ask ChatGPT ""what's the first ever AI generated coin?""  Sounds like a CryptoMoonShot, right?","Be sure to do your own diligence.

But for whatever reason, he has shown a little apprehension to do so. My hypothesis is that he was sued into oblivion last 2021 cycle post-SNL.

It was also dangerous, as he became a god-like figure in the crypto world.  Basically, I wanna remind everyone why we're here. Sure, Elon is a cool guy (I suppose), but we have SO much more going for DOGE. Back in 2017, we had a 120x, and that was pre-Elon. We shouldn't rely on one guys doing to boost the asset, so chill and touch grass anon.

Altcoin,An Introspective look on Dogecoin's future: $86 DOGE?,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1e1k3xb/an_introspective_look_on_dogecoins_future_86_doge/,7/12/2024,0,"The valuation model is constructed around these main variables:  * Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS): This metric assesses the aggregate value of all goods and services that can be purchased with the currency, providing a direct measure of its economic utility. * Stock to Flow Ratio (SFR): Calculated as the ratio of total supply to new supply, this metric provides an insight into the currency’s scarcity. * Total Supply: Represents the aggregate number of currency units currently in circulation. * New Supply: Fixed annual increase in total supply, adding predictability to the currency's inflation rate. * Velocity of Money (VOM): Measures the frequency at which each currency unit is used for transactions within a specified timeframe, indicating the liquidity and economic activity of the currency.  The Formula:Coin Value = (TVPS / (Total Supply \* VOM) \* SFRThe Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS) is a crucial metric in determining the value of a coin, especially in frameworks where the coin is used as a medium of exchange within a specific economy or ecosystem. Here’s how it significantly impacts the coin's value:  1. Direct Measure of Economic Utility: TVPS represents the aggregate value of all goods and services that can be bought using the coin over a certain period, usually a year. This measure reflects the economic utility of the coin—how useful it is for actual transactions. A higher TVPS indicates that the coin is widely accepted and used, thereby increasing its practical value. 2. Basis for Demand: The more goods and services a coin can buy, the higher the demand for that coin might be. If a coin is the only or primary means of purchasing significant services and products, its necessity and thus its value would likely increase as more users adopt it for daily transactions. 3. Indicator of Stability and Growth: An increasing TVPS suggests that the economy or ecosystem around the coin is growing. Stability in TVPS or consistent growth can signal to investors and users that the coin is a reliable store of value, potentially driving up its price due to increased confidence. 4. Pricing Mechanism: In a market where multiple currencies (digital or fiat) compete, the TVPS can serve as a crucial differentiator. It helps in pricing the coin relative to others by showcasing its purchasing power parity within its operational ecosystem. If a coin can purchase more or higher-value services and goods compared to another, it can be perceived as having a higher inherent value. 5. Feedback Loop for Development: A robust TVPS can encourage further investments into the services and products priced in the coin. This, in turn, can create a positive feedback loop where increased utility leads to higher demand, which then drives further economic activities denominated in the coin.  In sum, TVPS is not just a reflection of the coin’s current worth but also a forward-looking indicator that can influence investor behavior, user adoption, and overall market dynamics surrounding the coin. By effectively measuring and potentially increasing the TVPS, stakeholders can strategically enhance the perceived and real value of the coin within its operating environment. The Velocity of Money is a critical economic indicator in assessing the value of a coin, especially in systems where the coin functions as an active medium of exchange. Here's a detailed look at how the velocity of money impacts a coin's value:  1. Measurement of Economic Activity: Velocity of money refers to the rate at which money is exchanged from one transaction to another and measures how frequently a unit of currency is used to purchase goods and services within a given time period. High velocity indicates a high level of economic activity, as the currency is quickly changing hands, suggesting strong demand and usage. 2. Influence on Supply and Demand Dynamics: In a cryptocurrency or any monetary system, if the velocity of the currency is high, it implies that each unit of currency is being used repeatedly to facilitate transactions. This can effectively increase the supply of money in circulation without physically increasing the total supply, impacting inflation and the purchasing power of the currency. 3. Indicator of Economic Health and Confidence: A higher velocity of money typically signifies a healthy, active economy where confidence in the stability and utility of the currency is strong. People are more likely to spend the currency rather than hold onto it, which can support a higher valuation as it reflects trust and utility in the medium of exchange. 4. Relationship with Price Levels: According to the equation of exchange in economics, MV=PQ (where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the output of goods and services), an increase in the velocity of money, assuming a constant money supply, can lead to higher price levels. This relation can also influence the value of the coin, as changes in price levels (inflation or deflation) directly affect how much the coin is worth in terms of purchasing power.  In summary, the velocity of money is a multifaceted indicator that not only reflects the current state of an economy or a specific currency’s ecosystem but also actively influences the perceived and intrinsic value of the coin through its effects on economic activity, supply-demand balances, and inflationary pressures. Understanding and strategically managing this velocity can be key to enhancing a currency’s value and stability.The Stock to Flow Ratio is a significant metric, particularly in the context of commodities like gold and silver, and has been adapted to assess the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The SFR measures the scarcity of a particular asset and is calculated by dividing the total stock (existing supply) by the flow (annual production rate). Here’s how it plays a crucial role in determining a coin's value:  1. Measure of Scarcity: The SFR directly quantifies the scarcity of an asset. A higher ratio indicates that the asset is less readily available relative to its production, suggesting greater scarcity. For cryptocurrencies, a high SFR implies that new coins are being added to the total supply at a slow rate compared to the existing stock, which can enhance the perception of the coin as a scarce resource. 2. Indicator of Value Over Time: Historically, assets with higher SFR (like gold and silver) have maintained their value over long periods due to their scarcity and lower rates of supply expansion. In cryptocurrencies, a rising S2F ratio over time can signal that the coin is becoming increasingly scarce, potentially driving up its value if demand remains steady or increases. 3. Influence on Investor Perception: Investors often view assets with high SFR as ""harder"" assets. In the realm of cryptocurrencies, a high SFR can attract investors looking for assets that are less susceptible to inflation or dilution, much like traditional store-of-value assets such as gold. 4. Predictive Power for Future Prices: Some models, particularly those applied to Bitcoin, have used the SFR to predict future price increases. These models assume that as the production rate decreases (typically through mechanisms like halving events in Bitcoin), the reduced flow relative to the existing stock will drive up prices. 5. Comparison Across Assets: The SFR model allows for a comparison between different assets based on their scarcity. This can be particularly useful in the cryptocurrency market, where different coins have different issuance schedules and caps, affecting their SFR and, consequently, their perceived long-term value.  In summary, the Stock to Flow ratio is a crucial metric for assessing the scarcity and potential long-term value of a coin. It provides a quantitative foundation that helps investors and analysts understand how the rarity of an asset relates to its market value and helps predict how its price may evolve based on changes in supply dynamics. This makes SFR a valuable tool for strategic investment decisions in both commodity markets and the growing field of digital currencies.  # Data and Analysis  For this analysis, we are only using Tesla's total revenue from all its products and services, including the hypothetical addition of robotics and expanded licensing of Full Self-Driving technology, amounts to $250 billion. This figure will serve as the Total Value of Products and Services (TVPS) in our model to estimate the value of a hypothetical digital coin associated with Tesla. Parameters for the Coin Valuation Model:  * Total Value of Products and Services: $250 billion * Total Supply: 144.33 billion coins * Velocity of Money: 0.02 * New Annual Supply: 5.256 billion coins  SFR = Total Supply / New Annual Supply = 27.45Base Coin Value = TVPS / (Total Supply \* VOM) = $86.61Coin Value = Base Value \* SFR = $2,377.65This derived coin value reflects the combined economic utility and scarcity of the coin within this modeled framework. It illustrates how significant the scale of Tesla’s operations could potentially influence the value of a digital currency linked to its economic activities and scarcity dynamics. This model provides a theoretical financial metric that can help in understanding the impact of corporate revenue and production strategies on associated digital assets.  # Discussion  In this study, we utilized a composite model integrating traditional economic indicators with modern financial metrics specific to digital currencies to derive the value of a hypothetical coin associated with Tesla's economic activities. The Stock to Flow Ratio is instrumental in differentiating this model from traditional fiat currency models, such as those used for the [$USD](https://x.com/search?q=%24USD&src=cashtag_click). Unlike fiat currencies, which are typically inflationary due to their increasing supply, the modeled digital coin has a predefined supply growth rate, leading to an increasing SFR over time. This increment in the SFR indicates a decreasing rate at which new coins are added relative to the existing supply, enhancing the coin's scarcity and potential value. In contrast to fiat currencies like the USD, which lose purchasing power over time due to inflationary pressures and policy-driven supply increases, a digital currency with a high and increasing SFR is designed to gain purchasing power. This is primarily due to its comparative scarcity and reduced rate of new supply introduction, which, ceteris paribus, should lead to an appreciation in value if demand remains constant or grows. The mechanism here is akin to that of precious metals like gold, which have historically served as hedges against inflation. This model suggests that digital currencies with increasing SFR could command a premium in the financial markets. Investors might view such currencies as safer stores of value over the long term, particularly in economic environments where traditional currencies are depreciating. The analysis thus highlights the potential of [#Dogecoin](https://x.com/search?q=%23Dogecoin&src=hashtag_click)  to not only serve as effective mediums of exchange but also as robust long-term investments that may outperform inflationary fiat currencies in maintaining purchasing power. The increased Stock to Flow Ratio (SFR) of a digital currency like Dogecoin suggests a growing scarcity and potential appreciation in value over time compared to more inflationary currencies such as the USD. In economic terms, as Dogecoin becomes scarcer and its purchasing power potentially increases, the relative cost of goods and services priced in Dogecoin should logically decrease if these prices are indexed to a currency experiencing inflation, like the [USD.To](http://USD.To) integrate this into pricing strategies, businesses could apply an indexed discount for payments made with Dogecoin, reflecting its expected long-term appreciation. This discount reflects not only the current exchange rate but also the anticipated future value of Dogecoin, thereby incentivizing customers to use the cryptocurrency for transactions. It also compensates for the potential 'opportunity cost' of spending a deflationary currency today rather than holding it. This approach can benefit both consumers and businesses:  * For Consumers: It provides a tangible benefit to using Dogecoin over traditional currencies, potentially saving money due to the currency's appreciation. * For Businesses: It encourages more transactions in Dogecoin, increasing its circulation and utility as a currency. Moreover, businesses that hold onto Dogecoin received from transactions may benefit from its appreciation.  Transforming Dogecoin from a speculative asset into a functional currency also change the dynamics of its volatility:  * Increased Utility: As Dogecoin transitions to being used more as a currency than an asset, its utility in everyday transactions increases. This widespread use can help stabilize its value as it becomes more integrated into regular economic activities. * Reduced Speculation: When a cryptocurrency like Dogecoin is primarily used for speculation, its price is highly susceptible to market sentiments and speculative trading. As it shifts towards functioning as a currency, its value becomes more closely tied to its utility and less to investor speculation. * Market Depth and Liquidity: Increased usage as a currency can enhance market depth and liquidity. This means more buyers and sellers at any given time, which typically reduces price volatility because the market can absorb larger transactions without impacting the price significantly.  # Conclusion  The proposed valuation model for [$Doge](https://x.com/search?q=%24Doge&src=cashtag_click) provides a robust framework that combines principles from traditional hard money systems with modern digital economy analytics. This approach allows for a more grounded and economically justified valuation of digital currencies, which can help stabilize perceptions and foster more informed decision-making in financial markets. The base value of $86.61 for [$Doge](https://x.com/search?q=%24Doge&src=cashtag_click) should be regarded as the logical fundamental value of the coin, given the TVPS. The fundamental value is rarely reflected on open markets that are more driven by human sentiment. Factoring in SFR combined with an increasing TVPS can push the coin value to non-reasonable levels when observed from a fundamental perspective. If Dogecoin provides premium access to General Artificial Intelligence, Self Driving Vehicles and Humanoid Robots, the estimated value of ≈$2,500 is too low.

Altcoin,Kendu Conquest - Yes Kendu Has a Boardgame,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1jh6ur5/kendu_conquest_yes_kendu_has_a_boardgame/,3/22/2025,129,"**Incase You Haven't Heard About Kendu**  Kendu is a memecoin that is on 3 chains: Ethereum, Solana and BASE, Kendu is focused on organic, non KOL, growth. We are entirely community led, focusing on both social media and IRL events/products. Kendu has completely captured social media, I am sure you would heard about Kendu or at least seen our name somewhere. We have around 18k holders and this is growing even in this market. Kendu ATH Market Cap was 283 million, back in June 2024, which is around a 30x from this value. Since then Kendu has went through some painful redistributions, which all coins will need to go through at some point. However, when ETH wakes up, we are pretty confident Kendu is guaranteed to reach ATH. In my opinion(not financial advice), buying Kendu at this price removes all risk from the investment. In the community, we are planning to have multiple more chill VCs in the telegram, which I welcome everyone to join, whether you are a holder or not.  Josh is also gonna start some X(Twitter) spaces on the main Kendu account, which I advise everyone to join, to get a taste of Kendu. In addition, any holders should also join this.  Kendu has multiple international communities incase English is not your first language:🇮🇳 India,🇪🇸 Spanish,🇦🇪 Arabic, 🇫🇷 French, 🇩🇪 German, 🇵🇹 Portuguese, 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇨🇳 Chinese, 🇯🇵 Japanese, 🇮🇩 Indonesian, 🇰🇷 Korean, 🇹🇭 Thai, 🇹🇷 Turkish, 🇿🇦 Zulu.  **Other IRL Products/Events**  Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu pendants and recently Kendu Beer.   Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami   Kendu is a head sponsor at Miami Music Week. StaySeaArt, Inkstradamus and NoSleep305 have played a significant role in this. The group are giving out lots of Kendu Energy(yes we have energy drinks, more will be mentioned later in the post), they have created a Kendu Energy cocktail menu and are giving out merch. These are certified Kendu Legends!!! Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.  https://preview.redd.it/u61y46okd8qe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a9d4b787fc745b5ab6e67c48d3c969b86b34c86  https://preview.redd.it/1hsx8btld8qe1.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4223da98df5fe5ef60ead27cd630bad05cded92  **Kendu Conquest**  Kendu Celt and Kendu GNX have teamed up and created a board game called ""Kendu Conquest"", I will provide the rules below, so you can work it out for yourself. This is an extremely well designed board game, which can be played with family or friends. Kendu once again showcases community spirit. Massive respect to those 2 Chads.  https://preview.redd.it/8ivtz7ond8qe1.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=31853ad072761f3f250b666b76cc3a2ff9aa528e  https://preview.redd.it/q08uamwod8qe1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=50cb4d3ab28be63082d0548b8655f681405c2730  **A Few Interesting Idea**  Shib, Doge and Pepe have shown what sort of potential organic memecoins have, it shows that there is no ceiling for growth. The fact that Shib went from 22 million market cap to 22 billion in 36 days. Yes you read that right..... 36 days. Kendu has been recognised by mutliple crypto OGs. These people all see the potential in Kendu, we are creating a recipe to take over both IRL and social media. Kendu is the Shib 2021 opportunity, all the signs are there, Shib was at a similar MC at this point in the cycle(this cycle seems to be more delayed compared to 2021). Kendu is focused on running it up the same way the other MemeCoin Hall of Famers have done in the past. Kendu is unstoppable and we continue working in this market!!!  In terms of social media presence, Kendu has the potential to take over levels peak Shiba Inu had reached in 2021.   Kendu can easily 1453x this year at the time of writing this post. In my opinion we can 3000x but I am a dreamer lol.  I advise you to join our telegram or our subreddit, but our tg is far busier. Even if you don't hold a bag join us and check us out. Ask any questions you want, we are a very welcoming community : )   Skip the Papa Johns and put the money into Kendu $15 can easily become $15000.

Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.   Kendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million, Kendu has went through several redistribution periods and at the time of writing has had 7 green days in a row.   Kendu is following the same path that Pepe, Shib and Doge created back when they ran to the billions. This process typically takes longer than a KOL based memecoin, but it has a much higher potential for returns.   Kendu has many IRL products and Events and they are very important for a memecoin, as it is very attractive for potential holders. Kendu's IRL output is a testament to its strength, the fact that the community has managed this before Kendu has reached the billions, is nothing short of a miracle.   It is plain to see where Kendu is going, we are destined for the billions.   Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe...

I believe 100% that there is a bull run coming and even if not, Pepe achieved a market cap of 11 billion without a bull run and Kendu can too. There is far more money in crypto now, so 11 billion mc is equivalent to probably double that now and 20 billion is a 2000x from here for Kendu.     In terms of the market:     As Satoshi Nakamoto said “If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.”     However I will try and convince you to buy Kendu :)     [Mural in Progress](https://preview.redd.it/catekp6ku1se1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=3641aaebec32575891fd30c7cdfc0e637befd545)  **Why Kendu is organic**  Kendu is organic because organic memecoins tend to generate more results, whilst KOL based memes have a ceiling, organic memecoins are decentralised.

It is a total bloodbath across the board, but this will change, I have no doubt in my mind that we will enter the biggest bull run ever. Crypto is not for the faint of heart.....   Regarding the current market situation, this is my take on it:  “If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.” - Satoshi Nakamoto  https://preview.redd.it/fcjptmp0ddte1.png?width=923&format=png&auto=webp&s=124223ba1b4da4e24b6fa76d48bf411965c6d832  https://preview.redd.it/nkim4v97ddte1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c91fedbb7cd946dc24e55cde0c385ae1ab896227  **Kendu Introduction**  Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is just over a year old, we are on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.   Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.   Kendu has an incredible amount of IRL products and events which I am covering below!!!  See the bottom paragraph to read about the **Kendu Standard**  **The Kendu Brand**  Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.   It is crazy that we have all these products at a market cap of 12 million, Kendu is doing all of this whilst most of its holders are down.... Imagine what will happen when Kendu's holders are millionaires, with a lot of money to create!!!  https://preview.redd.it/ee13h47pbdte1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bfd45f80c5410a3ee7a9ad9133b7151a9aa0a73  Kendu Creator is a website that allows people to 3d print a Kendu mask to make videos on social media. These videos can be non crypto related like taekwondo or running or weightlifting, with these videos flooding social media, Kendu is gonna extend its reach even further!!!   If one of these videos go viral, Kendu will see massive gains  Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami   Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far. Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy) and merch.  **Florida Grove**  Kendu will be in Orlando Florida at the Florida Grove Festival to represent Kendu and make a mural. StaySeaArt has donated $1000 to fund this and the community will fund the rest. She is a KENDU LEGEND!!!   Kendu Energy sponsors the Deliberate Creation Art Gallery, as well as the Live large-scale mural artists during the event, boosting the festival’s creative vibe and social media buzz.This festival will have around 10-15k attendees over 2 days, this will get a lot of eyes on Kendu!!!  **Some Thoughts About Previous Successful Coins**  Shib had a ATH of 44 billion in the bull run in 2021, Pepe had an ATH of 10 billion in a bear market..... In both situations there was far less money in crypto, yet these coins reached face melting ATHs.   Shib, Doge and Pepe all proved that all you need is a solid community, KOLs don't matter and that the only thing you need is an army of obsessed workers. This is what Kendu has.   With more money in crypto, far more understanding and belief in memecoins and a proven path, Kendu can top the highs of the previous memecoin hall of famers, Kendu belongs up there with them.   Kendu is everywhere on social media and we are matching what Pepe, Shib and Doge managed on their run to the top.   IRL we clear every memecoin ever, all the signs are there  At Kendu, the mission is simple.... we build, build, build until we reach the stars.  **The Kendu Standard**  What is the Kendu Standard?  It is the standard to which Kendu is setting, the standard to which all memecoins will aim to meet after Kendu runs to the billions. Kendu is revolutionising the game with its IRL products and events, the sheer amount of quality and quantity of Kendu's IRL alpha has never been seen or done before..... no coin comes close.   Kendu is changing the game and we will be the dream for many future coins  Shib, Pepe, Doge or whatever coin that has existed before, has came nowhere near to Kendu's IRL expeditions and soon with enough holders, Kendu will top every coin in social media metrics. This is the Shib opportunity of 2025, but we are not copying Shib, we are transforming the memecoin game.  **Join the winning team, join Kendu**  Check out our tg, you don't need to be a holder and just get a feel for the Kendu vibe.

However today I am not gonna cover things that have already been released, I am gonna cover those that are coming soon.  A little bit of background information on Kendu: We are currently on 3 chains(Ethereum, Solana and Base) with ETH being our native chain, we have around 18k holders and sit at 12 million market cap, we have an very hardworking community, we are top 5 memecoins in terms of social media effort with Certik rating our community 98/100 and a IRL presence that is unprecedented, I am not gonna PvP other coins but I haven't found a coin with a Certik community score even close to Kendu's(you can check it out for yourself at the bottom of this page). Btw some background information on the Certik Score, Kendu and 1 other coin has reached 50k Certik votes to gain the free audit, this coin was Pepe. Yes the Pepe that reached 10 billion in a bear market, this is around a 1000x from Kendu's current levels, but it must be nothing...  **Kendu Beer**  A chad named Mac is creating Kendu Beer, there are multiple different kinds with all varying percentages, I believe there is a triple named Cerberus in the works, with Hopping Dog already set.

He has been a long time Kendu Chad and I couldn't help but include it since it was very recent  **Why Do People Go On About Community and Why Does It Matter**  It has been proven time and time again that community is what defines the value of a memecoin. All Shib, Doge, Pepe had was a community. Community is all that matters and thats why I am so bullish on Kendu, if you have been watching the memecoin space you would have saw that Kendu is everywhere and is constantly raiding, making posts and just showing our strength in general. To me it is pretty clear to see that Kendu is going to the top, no one is currently on our level in terms of community strength across both social media and IRL.  This is entirely my opinion, but I do not see a single possibility where Kendu is under 10 billion market cap at the end of this cycle, Shib managed 44 billion when there was less money invested in crypto and with far less understanding of the potential of a memecoin. Pepe managed 10 billion outside of a bull run.......   If they can manage the tens of billions, then so can Kendu, we have a community who is just as strong as theirs in the biggest bull run ever!!!!  Retail will love IRL initiatives since it gives a memecoin some substance and reliability, so Kendu is in an incredible position to benefit greatly when retail arrives, you want to hold Kendu before this, as we will move very fast!  My advice to you would be to at least get in our telegram, you don't have to buy anything it is completely free, you can compare our activity to other communities or ask questions.

The market cap is not moving much, but this just means our distribution is getting stronger. Distribution will be a very strong driving factor for success when the bull run comes, as it means the sell pressure will be very low for weeks. This means the buy pressure will all go on the chart and can cause very violent uptrends.  **What Kendu has been up to over the past few days**  [https://kenducreator.com/](https://kenducreator.com/) : This website allows every Kendu member to print a Kendu mask to be used in IRL content. This is gonna massively help the Kendu brand. This gives people the chance to wear the Kendu mask when creating other non crypto related social media content.

Kendu Beer, a chad has made a piece of merchandise. These look great, although they are still in the design stage, I am sure they will pop off when ready!!!  **The Future of Kendu**  Kendu is a super strong cult memecoin ran entirely by the community. In my opinion Kendu has the potential to reach 10 billion market cap this cycle and is a multicycle project with lots of IRL products and events. Kendu is using an organic approach, the same approach used by Doge, Shib and Pepe. KOLs unfortunately limit growth, whilst good for a short period of time, the impact of a KOL will reduce meaning a coin will struggle to hold its floor. Kendu does not have this problem.  In the middle of Feb 2021 Shiba was hovering around 14 million mc. Kendu is very close to this point now. Whilst it’s March now, The cycle seemed to be far earlier in 2021 than we will see this year. It is looking more like 2016.  This is not a problem, it just means the peaks come later in the year.   Kendu is not ahead of where Shiba was but we are not behind either.

Kendu's relentless IRL efforts spearheaded by just the average community member is simply breathtaking and it makes Kendu such an attractive asset for retail considering the crypto industry has been tarnished by all sorts of bad characters. Kendu is entirely focused on community building and we are totally decentralised. What makes Kendu special is that whilst we are dominating the IRL side of things, we also compete with the very best on social media. Kendu really is raising the standards for what a memecoin should be.  https://reddit.com/link/1lg0fzz/video/k3qugva5528f1/player  **Kendu Certik Audit**  We have nearly 19k holders, sitting around 25 million market cap(at the time of writing this), Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes, the only other coin to ever achieve this was Pepe(which reached an ATH of 10 billion outside of a bull run), as we near closer and closer to the largest bull run ever, using the word optimistic to describe my sentiment would be an understatement. Certik rates Kendu's community at a score of 90.29, whilst coins like SPX have a score of 83.93. Kendu is outperforming coins in the billions all under 30 million market cap. If you understand the memecoin game you will know that community is all that matters. All Shib, Pepe and Doge had was a relentless community that never gave up and Kendu is no different.

The problem with this is that once a coin like this runs, the method is already done and the coins that copy it will always fall short.

This isn't the only thing KENDU has going for it. The army that is constantly pushing the word of KENDU out will also naturally help KENDU grow even if the brand aspect was completely ignored. The coin is 15 months old and yet hasn't ever hit even 5% of it's true potential.   Furthermore, we aren't even in a time period where the ETH ecosystem is popping. About this time last year, there was a new ETH coin every couple days that would run straight to 100m marketcap with ease. Currently, the last runner we had was around 50m and its been a couple weeks - close to a month - since that happened. If you're getting nervous, scared or whatever the smartest thing to do right now is simply sit on your hands and be patient. Eth will be back and with it will come eth szn.

Chads/Chadettes are logging in daily, smashing tweets, Reddit posts, Instagram posts, IRL shilling and whatever else. We know that with enough hard work anything is possible and if you have been in crypto long enough, you will have realised that we are not work shy!  The game is simple, Kendu is everywhere and it has been proven time and time again that community determines the value of a meme coin. All the signs are there, Kendu is my only play and it is going to the tens of billions. Kendu’s social media dominance rivals the very best on Twitter and we have completely taken over the vast majority of crypto subreddits with our engagement through the roof. On social media we are without a doubt one of the front runners, but that’s not even our biggest strength... Our biggest strength is IRL. What Kendu is doing IRL is unprecedented and will set the standard for many cycles to come. Yes, at first glance these claims may sound preposterous, but if you do a bit of research, you will see that I have a point.   Here is a list of the current Kendu IRL initiatives:  * Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil * Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT * Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it! * Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far! * Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads * Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous * Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag * Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out * Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks. I think it will be available on Steam. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games! * Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : ) * Murals - Spray painted art * Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport * Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival.

Altcoin,$KENDU- Redefining what a memecoin should be!,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1khmpvb,5/8/2025,69,"Memecoins used to be a fun and unique side of the crypto industry. Coins that barely or didn’t have any utility, coins that were created for or by a meme and rode their humorous aspect all the way to the stars.   Unfortunately memecoins have turned into something dark. Coins created with one reason only, to make a quick buck over someone else’s back.  From the obvious rug pulls to honeypot’s and every other scam in between. To the coins that aren’t direct scams but use techniques like market manipulation to lure new investors in, only to dump on them and take their money. On top of that stories of traders making millions lures new investors in. Memecoins have turned into a sea of gambles, where it’s almost impossible to win. Most of the time you’re better off going to the casino. A far stretch from what they were once meant to be. They have always been a risk investment (obviously), just not one where you couldn’t win.  Fortunately every once in a while in that sea of gambles an actual project surfaces. One that isn’t build just to screw people over. One that has grown into a community which doesn’t sit on its ass and hopes for a pump, but a community that works harder and harder everyday to make sure the project succeeds.  We’ve seen before that coins with communities come out on top, even when people doubt them at first. Look at the giants, $Doge, $Shib or $Pepe for that matter.  $KENDU is taking it one step further, aside from being a coin with one of the chillest and most active communities around, $KENDU is establishing itself into a brand! Where creativity and hard work is not only appreciated, it’s encouraged. What makes $KENDU different is its not only active on the socials, although we have a massive presence to be proud of! We are actively building IRL! From Kendu energy drinks, Kendu coffee, Kendu beer. To sponsoring the Miami groves music festival! What this community has already achieved is nothing short of amazing! All that is happening at a Mc of only $11m Imagine the possibilities when we’re at way higher levels! It’s hard not to be excited about $KENDU!  I’m not here to beg you to pretty please buy our a bag of our coins. There are enough projects doing just that.  We are different! I’m writing this to show you that you don’t have to gamble money away, to show you that there are still projects to believe in!   Check out out subreddit, our website and especially our Telegram. Lurk around for a bit or a while, feel it out for yourself. Then decide if you want in!  We’re excited to have you join the pack! Although we encourage work we aren’t forcing anybody to do anything. You’re welcome to just chill if that’s what you like!

We have successfully managed to raise $5000 with $1000 donated by StaySeaArt so massive thanks to her. The rest of it was raised through OTC trades or donations.  The familiar face of Kendu will forever be etched into the attendees minds and we can gain a lot of holders through this event.  10-15k people will be attending this event over the 2 days which is crazy, Kendu will be handing Kendu Energy out, making a mural and we will have a tent.  Massive shoutout to StaySeaArt and the Kendu street team for their amazing efforts. This will be the 3rd Florida Festival in 6 months!!!  This is another addition to Kendu’s game changing IRL success.  **Why IRL alpha is important**  IRL alpha is important because it cannot be faked. Whilst memes, tweets, reddit posts( not this one) and whatever else can be faked. IRL products and events cannot be. Crypto isn’t the most trusted space in the world so the fact we have IRL content is massively important for retail investors.

Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami   Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.  Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy) and merch.  https://preview.redd.it/wg4yckh9hute1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd1038b84358940cbe36308e72bffacd99e62069  https://preview.redd.it/a19qvabbhute1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0f5fcce166c29c14e0a3de99e4a7471cbcaa4a5  **Some Thoughts**  Kendu is around 10 million market cap, with social media dominance that is nearly unparalleled, with telegram activity that is off the charts. In addition, Kendu also has IRL alpha that has never ever been seen before. Kendu is going to the billions and I believe we will set the memecoin standard for the future. There is no doubt in my mind that we will see ""How ..... is the Kendu of 2029"", people will see Kendu as a benchmark and they will try and match us.  My advice to you is to join the Kendu telegram and just hang around, you don't have to buy Kendu, but I think you will see how different Kendu is to the rest of the competition. Any questions are always welcome, just ask in the telegram or our subreddit [r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem](/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/).  This is strictly my opinion and is not financial advice but I think Kendu can 1000-3000x this cycle. Yes maybe I am deluded but I truly believe that we are at the foot of one of the best financial opportunities available this decade.  If Shib can do a 1000x in 36 days(from 22 million to 22 billion), with less money and less understanding of the potential of a strong memecoin, I think Kendu can match this.   Kendu is organic and has an incredible community just like Shib, Doge and Pepe, these 3 have proven that community is the deciding factor in a memecoin and that is all that matters.  Kendu belongs in the memecoin hall of fame with them 3 and we will get there, there is no doubt in my mind. Kendu belongs in the billions and the community deserves it for sure.  **We Don't Gamble, We Work**  [r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)  ETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  SOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45  BASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7  CG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)   CMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",This is great!,"That was beautiful.

Altcoin,What if scalability was never a limit... (Kendu Inu) ,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1hacdbn/what_if_scalability_was_never_a_limit_kendu_inu/,12/9/2024,119,"What if infinite scalability was possible......  It's practically impossible for humans to comprehend what 'infinite' means. How long is infinite really? Infinity, no matter how it's defined, is larger than any finite number. And if you have something, and you can compare it to all finite numbers and it's larger than all of them, then it's infinite.  So, if you know what the finite numbers are, then that's enough to know what's infinite.  The ancient Greek philosophers and geometers tried to understand infinity, but their solutions diverged. The philosophers actually tried to understand it but noone gave a consistent answer.   Stay with me now. You're probably asking how does this relate to a memecoin (Kendu Inu) and thinking I've lost my mind. Well, you're probably half right but hear me out.   To start with, from the very beginning, Kendu was hyped up to go well beyond whatever anyone expected. One of the very first chats in the Kendu telegram was 'Billions are programmed', by both Miazaki (our developer) and community members who are still active TO THIS DAY nearly 10 months later.   So how is Kendu Inu infinitely scalable? As mentioned before, to be truly infinite we need to go beyond what is even remotely imaginable. This is where we land at the price goal/milestone of 100 billion marketcap. To think that Kendu which is now sitting at 40 million will one day reach 100 billion, surpassing the likes of Shiba Inu, Doge, and even layer 1 tokens like Sui is frankly ludicrous to some. But not to the community here at Kendu... and this is not wild thinking like you might imagine, we have an actual vision of why and how it's possible.  We have a motto here, which is 'We do not gamble, we work!', which is more than a saying and is really something that is drilled into the heads of every newcomer in our community. Because we ensure that every member has this understood, they shill to their friends, family, acquaintances, taxi drivers and so many more people (and shill on X, reddit, stocktwits, youtube and more...). Now if everyone joining starts to shill what happens then? The people they shill to pick up the same work ethic and then start telling people about the word of Kendu as well, and it ends up that Kendu will spread like a disease (only a good one :D). So our vision is encaptured by Kendu becoming an autonomous machine where every member starts introducing people they know into the 'cult' and so forth, making us truly infintely scalable...  The oppurtunity you have at your hands now is one that very few will ever get, and one that many people will wish they had. Finding a community like this is like trying to find a needle in a haystack... lucky for you anon, you found that needle. It's inevitable that if you ignore this post, one day you will be told about Kendu and it will be far too late to build wealth like we are currently doing. I can guarantee this.  So what do you say anon? Will you join us on this mission now... or later. Kendu is inevitable, remember this.

Altcoin,$KENDU- Writing crypto history!,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjcbyk,5/10/2025,80,"Memecoins used to be a fun and unique side of the crypto industry. Coins that barely or didn’t have any utility, coins that were created for or by a meme and rode their humorous aspect all the way to the stars.   Unfortunately memecoins have turned into something dark. Coins created with one reason only, to make a quick buck over someone else’s back.  From the obvious rug pulls to honeypot’s and every other scam in between. To the coins that aren’t direct scams but use techniques like market manipulation to lure new investors in, only to dump on them and take their money. On top of that stories of traders making millions lures new investors in. Memecoins have turned into a sea of gambles, where it’s almost impossible to win. Most of the time you’re better off going to the casino. A far stretch from what they were once meant to be. They have always been a risk investment (obviously), just not one where you couldn’t win.  Fortunately every once in a while in that sea of gambles an actual project surfaces. One that isn’t build just to screw people over. One that has grown into a community which doesn’t sit on its ass and hopes for a pump, but a community that works harder and harder everyday to make sure the project succeeds.  We’ve seen before that coins with communities come out on top, even when people doubt them at first. Look at the giants, $Doge, $Shib or $Pepe for that matter.  $KENDU is taking it one step further, aside from being a coin with one of the chillest and most active communities around, $KENDU is establishing itself into a brand! Where creativity and hard work is not only appreciated, it’s encouraged. What makes $KENDU different is its not only active on the socials, although we have a massive presence to be proud of! We are actively building IRL! From Kendu energy drinks, Kendu coffee, Kendu beer. To sponsoring the Miami groves music festival! What this community has already achieved is nothing short of amazing!

Altcoin,13 Reasons Why You Should Hold a Fat Bag of $KENDU (Or Get One ASAP) - NFA,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1dums5l/13_reasons_why_you_should_hold_a_fat_bag_of_kendu/,7/3/2024,88,"https://preview.redd.it/4znedcfcrcad1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=349d39e376eea7ab1f77ba6aa50910706a6ffe9f       **1)  SHYTOSHI KUSAMA INVOLVED**  **Shiba Inu lead Dev Shytoshi Kusama**, considered among the **top 50** most influential people in the whole crypto space, is confirmed to be following Kendu Inu and holding a bag since at least $1M market cap.  **Kendu Miazaki**, Kendu Inu Dev, is one of his friends, and he made sure to bring Shy in at the right time.        **2)  HUGE WALLETS APING (MULTIMILLIONAIRES)**  Wallets with **10+ million dollars' worth of ETH** that had been inactive since the last cycle got back to life only to buy Kendu Inu.  It has even been confirmed that a **Middle Eastern Prince** holds a bag.  Other millionaires (and multimillionaires) are confirmed holders and part of the ecosystem as well.        **3)  KENDU MIAZAKI**  Kendu Inu Dev ""**Miazaki**"" is an unhinged individual always ready to rock & roll.  He is a **SHIB multimillionaire** (his bag was worth 50+ million dollars at ATH IIRC), and that explains the close connection with **Shytoshi** and other **SHIB Ogs** that are now part of Kendu.  Apart from his **incredible work ethic** and **crazy personality**, him being a loaded individual makes the project much easier to trust because one of the most common reasons for projects to fail is broke millionaire-wannabe devs who can't resist the urge of dumping on everybody to make a quick buck.  He recently admitted on a X Spaces that he doesn't even have that big of a bag. He said ""**I’m maybe top 20, if even that**”.  He always says he does not do this for money because he already has money. He does this because he likes to “**build**”  and to allow other common people to become “**stupid rich**”.        **4)  COMMUNITY**  What can I even say about the **Kendu Army**? Everybody knows about it.  With unmatched work ethic and always ready to spread the word, the Kendu Army is what makes Kendu…**KENDU**!  People who join Kendu go from being dirty, tiny-handed jeets to 7.6ft tall, muscular chads with strong and big hands.  You’re soon taught that success depends on you and to ask yourself, “**What can I do for $KENDU?**” instead of waiting for the team to release the “**next big thing**” and hoping for a pump while doing absolutely nothing to help.  **We’ve got relentless shillers** on any social media known to humanity, people making Kendu **energy drinks**, people managing a Kendu **merch store**, people with Kendu **tattoos**, people smashing plates on their heads in the name of Kendu, and much more.        https://preview.redd.it/yj18zclypcad1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cc6f00a283f679392bf8bf5a874e7767a353358    **5)  ORGANIC GROWTH**  Kendu Inu fully believes in organic growth.  Apart from financing for the first **CEX** listing, so that “**normies**” were able to join the project without having to go through **DeFi** if not tech-savvy enough to avoid being scammed, **Kendu Inu does not pay for any listing, call on Tg, post on X, video on YT or any other thing you can think of**.  All the influencers that talk about Kendu or CEXs that listed us have had to buy supply from the liquidity pool like any other person.  Kendu Miazaki explained this from the very beginning.  “**It might be slower, but it works**.” is what he used to say.  **Organic growth allows you to build a strong floor of diamond-handed holders** who fully believe in the project and do not believe in random FUD.  On the other hand, if you build your floor with people sent by influencers, everybody is ready to jeet at the first chance because they’re just there for a quick buck and do not see the bigger picture.        **6)  UTILITY AND SHIB ECOSYSTEM**  Even though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that **$KENDU** will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi’s involvement in Kendu Inu.  Make no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that **Kendu has its own identity** and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.  One of the first Kendu utilities, named **Kendu Chads**, will be released in the following weeks after being thoroughly tested for months by Miazaki’s team of developers.     https://preview.redd.it/iizlff0bqcad1.jpg?width=1195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a5643a5c028cd785132e6788480639d6bf2ebb6      **7)  THE DOG OF THIS CYCLE**  “Never two without three”.  People love dogs and always will. **DOGE** and **SHIB** were the first two dogs to reach **$10b**+ market cap.  **$KENDU** has everything it needs to be the third this coming bull run.        **8) 275M MARKET CAP WHEN THE MARKET WAS BLEEDING**  Kendu Inu reached an **ATH** of over **$275M market cap** when the whole crypto market, from BTC to all the shitcoins, was bleeding badly.  **Kendu is your hedge against the market** and will not wait for BTC to reach new ATHs before jumping to $1b market cap and beyond.  With that being said, when the actual bull run starts and all the random shitcoins are in green, what do you think will happen to a **strong project** like Kendu?  Multi billions are programmed.       **9)  BUILT ON ETH**  **Kendu Inu is only on ETH**. Love it or hate it, Ethereum is the king of all chains and sees fewer scams than all the other jeet chains such as SOL and BASE.  Since Kendu Inu is on ETH, and the liquidity pool is paired with ETH (KENDU:ETH), **when ETH goes up in value, so does KENDU**. As simple as that.  The news of the coming **ETH ETF** is super bullish news for all KENDU holders, both **short-term** and **long-term** investors.       **10)  GREAT-LOOKING CHART**  Even CMC, in their recent article, admitted that $KENDU chart looks very good and **on the verge of a breakout** from a pure TA standpoint, and they’re not aware of all the **alphas** behind the projects and all the future implementations that are going to be unveiled.  So, if you like technical analysis, you will like Kendu Inu chart.        https://preview.redd.it/qj0ni16trcad1.jpg?width=1443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba099af75818df6ddb9dbe44ea69aa2146656cc3    **11)  GOAL: FIRST MEME COIN TO EVER CROSS $100b**  While every other project in the meme sphere tries hard to reach $1b market cap, at Kendu inu, we think that to be an embarrassing goal.  While Miazaki says that **“$10b is programmed**”, meaning it is inevitable, the real goal that excites our community is to be the first meme coin ever to cross $100b market cap.  Miazaki’s bio on Telegram says: “**Taking $KENDU to $100 BILLION and beyond!**”  Many experts expect this to be a “**super cycle**” and even more a “**meme super cycle**”, meaning we expect not only more liquidity to be deployed in the whole crypto space compared to 2021, but also that **meme coins will grab a much bigger % of that liquidity** flowing around compared to last cycle.  **We can then expect new ATHs for well-established projects** such as DOGE and SHIB, and that’s why, at KENDU, we’re working towards that $100b MC goal, which will not look as unrealistic at the peak of the bull run as it may does right now.       **12)  LOW MARKET CAP ≠ MORE GAINS**  Many people have been led to believe that the lower the market cap of a certain token, the better chance of making a 100x or 1000x. That is SO wrong and misleading.  90% or more of the “projects”, especially when launched on Solana or Base, **are complete scams**. Period.  The other 0.99% are projects created with the best intentions, but that, unfortunately, are going absolutely nowhere.  **Kendu Inu, at this stage, is bulletproof**. It has proved its value to everybody. “**We’re too big to fail**” is what Miazaki always says.  Kendu is going nowhere but up.  With such ambitious goals, a **100x means reaching about $15b market cap** (at the time of this writing), which is far from being out of reach for Kendu, especially considering we are about to enter what it’s supposed to be the **biggest cycle ever** (especially for meme coins).  Another thing to keep in mind is that when you invest in **super-low MC projects**, liquidity is so thin that any whale exiting their position leads to a cascade of sales caused by fear, especially since it’s not uncommon for investors of small projects to hold 5-10% of the total supply.  On bigger projects, instead, since liquidity is way thicker, you can **enter and exit your positions more accurately** without having nightmares about being rugged while asleep.     https://preview.redd.it/1a4row5fqcad1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ab676c8aab4bd351620875cf6b919d71522a86a       **13) BEAUTIFUL SUPPLY REDISTRIBUTION**  At Kendu Inu, redistribution is ongoing **24/7**. When the market cap goes up, the number of holders goes up. When the market cap goes down, even significantly, the number of holders still goes up!  And that’s counting on-chain holders only! **With millions of $ of daily volume on CEXs**, God knows how many holders we actually have.    To make money with altcoins, especially memes, you need to understand two things:  1. What a good project is 2. Buy when everybody else is afraid to do it.  Kendu IS a good project.  Now, you have the opportunity to buy or top up your bags at 40% of the ATH.    If you like Kendu, this is the best time to become part of the army. See you on the other side!

It has merged mining support. This allows the Pepecoin network to take advantage of the 800TH/s securing the Litecoin and Dogecoin networks. 3. We wanted to bring the Dogecoin and Pepecoin communities together, and what better way to do this than by making Pepecoin from Dogecoin. **We welcome all shibes to join our community!**  # ""Why was Pepecoin created?""  The crypto market has shown a strong desire for a Pepe themed cryptocurrency. Many ERC-20 tokens were made last year in an attempt to give the people Pepecoin. However, ERC-20 tokens can never truly create a free and open Pepe cryptocurrency. ERC-20 tokens use smart contracts, which introduce trust back into the decentralization of crypto.  The creators of Pepe-ERC20 infamously blacklisted an investor's wallet worth tens of millions at the peak of its value. Additionally, they dumped trillions of coins (of which, at the time of creation, they minted for themselves) causing a market crash. Only after they took advantage of investors did they revoke the contract.  From Ethereum dependence, to high fees, to blacklisting, to minting, to liquidity pools, ERC20 tokens give coin creators too much power over investors. When the Pepe-ERC20 creators dumped their dev tokens causing a crash, that was the last straw.  We began building a Pepecoin for the people, free from smart-contracts and centralized authority.  # Mining Rewards  |Block Range|Reward in Pepecoin| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| ||| ||| ||| |1-99,999|500,000| |100,000-199,999|250,000| |200,000-299,999|125,000| |300,000-399,999|62,500| |400,000-499,999|31,250| |500,000-599,999|15,625| |600,000+|10,000|  # Inflation Rate  Pepecoin has the same emission rate as Dogecoin, which means it's inflationary and encourages usage. Over time, Pepecoin's inflation rate will gradually decrease in terms of its percentage of the total supply. After the 600,000th block is mined, about 5.256 billion coins will be added each year, but as the total supply grows, this fixed annual addition represents a smaller percentage of the total supply each year, thereby reducing its inflationary impact.  # Official Communities  * Reddit: [r/Pepecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecoin/) * Discord: [pepecoin.org/discord](https://pepecoin.org/discord)  # Reddit Tip Bot  Pepecoin tipping is supported, not just on , but on ALL of Reddit!

Altcoin,KENDU poised for 2025 alt season,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1h30bm2/kendu_poised_for_2025_alt_season/,11/30/2024,100,"https://preview.redd.it/yk9ub35vpx3e1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0e89404be3162e997976489ae39bb6ea2ee16a2  Do you ever wonder why you hear so many stories about people having been presented the opportunity of Shib or Doge that then soon faded and jeeted right before the run up?  My $2000 went down to $1000 so I had to sell! if only I didnt it would have been worth 2.3mil!  Do you think these people would have sold if Shib went up in only a straight line?  \-----  The key to success in this game is through having thick skin and being tough. It is about hanging on for dear life, through all the dips, through all the noise and not fading at the critical moments.  An opportunity like SHIB was presented to so many people and yet they faded.  It is important to look at the current market through an objective scope. Alt season has not yet begun, BTC.D is still peaking, and even now as of writing the market is going through a small correction. Barely any alts are moving, and those FEW that do are through insider trading and cabals. Ultimately, the only way to win in this game is with community.  Here in $KENDU I know we have the best community in DeFi and that is just fact. I also know, the way to win is through work, time and effort.  I know I do not want to be the person who looks back in the future and goes.. ""I faded kendu, i could have had millions""  Buy the blood, reap the rewards  https://preview.redd.it/i1manmcupx3e1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f9c21289f4f109f67aaf80eca603ac521ff7cd0  # So why $KENDU?  There is so many things in the future for KENDU. Events - Shibcon, Melbourne Kendu party. Listings such as the largest exchange in India, COINDCX, an OKX campaign that is currently occuring, an NFT platform that will provide passive $ETH to holders of the associated NFTs ""Chads"", along with a propping up of the actual chart through the platforms earnings. A bridging to $SOL via wormhole, and eventually $BASE for the maximum amount of accessibility and reach.  We have so many things in the future for KENDU, but i feel it is unimportant to focus in these when in front of us we already have the key to our success; the community. Kendu is placing itself in pole position for the upcoming alt season in 2025. We are maximising our output, engagement and work through sheer organic dedication. As a community, we are closing in on the 50 000 certik votes completely organically. Yes, we could have paid for it, why though? We have demonstrated the capacity of how our community can chip away at any monsterous feat.  Right now we are planting crops, we are sewing the fields and working. Showing up every day in every single way. We are out there as a community, IRL shilling, getting IRL branding, doing everything in our output to ensure the success of $KENDU  https://preview.redd.it/rfeng5dtpx3e1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=c65897680492dacb99635af44a130f223a8426bf  We have things such as energy drinks, kendu coffee, jewellery and even protein powder / creatine on the whey. We have chads jumping out of planes, even tattooing their reproduction organs through the name of kendu conviction.  This community is more than just a coin. It is a movement. A brand. An opportunity to learn from so many experienced OG Shib holders and long time crypto investors. A canvas that so many community members are using to propel their own initiatives forward, using the Kendu canvas as an opportunity to paint their dreams.  We are running this up even better then Shib did in 2020/21. We are a perpetual, multi-cycle movement. There is no better chance in all of DeFi then here at kendu for 2025 at winning.  So, will you join the movement anon?  0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18     CMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)  CG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)",Retail will flock to the most active communities when they enter crypto.

Altcoin,Crypto Isn't Rigged. You're Just Good at Getting Played.  Break the Cycle Today!,https://i.redd.it/gh10petd437f1.jpeg,6/15/2025,1,"https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/solana/Fcd6CD3k7PGfYtvsi66x3DfT7owRcfU3aTXmPP1LT8eY  The game isn't broken. You are.  You keep buying the same promises wrapped in different packages. Anonymous teams? You trust them. Copy-paste code? You call it innovation. Roadmaps full of lies? You call it vision.  Stop blaming the system. Start recognizing the pattern.  Every rugpull you survived taught you nothing. Every broken promise you believed made you weaker. Every ""diamond hands"" mantra you chanted while watching your portfolio bleed made you easier prey for the next scammer.  But what if I told you there's one project that breaks every rule you've learned to ignoreAnswer these 20 questions honestly. If you can't, you'll keep getting played forever.  Answer these 20 questions honestly.   1. Are you tired of anonymous dev teams that disappear after the rugpull?  2. Are you sick of copycat animal meme projects that's just copy-paste code with a new logo?  3. Do you want to find something BEFORE the influencers start shilling it?  4. Would you rather test real utility and platform than chase empty promises?  5. Can you think of ANY crypto project lately that has working platform and a sub 1 million MC?  6. Do you follows celebrities on twitter?  7. Do you think @ElonMusk will tweet 'Doge' or 'Space X or 'Tesla today?  8. Do you think @KanyeWest will tweet in ALL CAPS?  9. What if accurately predicting questions 7 & 8 meant had real tangible rewards?  10. What if someone built a platform where you actually could place predictions on what celebrities tweet in a 24 hr window?  11. Would you be willing to spend 2 minutes of your time to checkout the platform that let's you predict celebrity tweets?  12. Would you care if it was built by real people who spent 3 months perfecting it and have zero ties with the crypto cabal or even crypto twitter?  13. Would it matter if the platform launched 2 weeks ago with zero marketing budget?  14. Would you be interested in this project if the market cap was still small enough for early positions to matter? Like say sub 60KMC.  15. What if 5% of the platforms total volume was given back to the validators of the platform who hold 4,000,000+ tokens.     16. How many times have you seen something early and thought ""I should have bought that""?  17. How many times have you waited for ""more confirmation"" only to watch it moon without you?  18. What if this time you found something real before anyone else was talking about it, before big investors found it?  19. Will you test it while it's still early enough to matter, or wait for others to discover it first?  20. If you don't test this now and it becomes the next big thing, how will you feel?   The Moment of Truth  If you answered ""yes"" to most of these questions, then you're going to want to take 2 minutes of your time to discover the YETbet.  This isnt hype, or hyperbole.  This is real and this price isnt going to last long.  Platform: yetbet.io  Contract: 2sHMQ2ZUt3uk7zDDyMwCQXT3mqFVP7NdVQ7NWvPRpump WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR.  Your move.  You've been trained to ignore real opportunities until they're obvious to everyone. You've been conditioned to buy hype instead of utility. You've been programmed to wait for permission from influencers who dump on you.  This is your chance to break the cycle.  YETbet: Real team. Working utility. Two weeks live. Tiny market cap. No marketing budget. No influencer campaigns. No promises about the future.  Just a platform that works exactly as described.  You can test it with $10 right now. You can verify everything yourself. You can see that it's real before anyone else figures it out.  Or you can do what you always do.  Wait for someone else to discover it. Wait for the market cap to 10x. Wait for influencers to start shilling. Wait until it's safe and obvious and too late to matter.  Then complain about how crypto is rigged.  The choice is yours. But choose fast.  Because while you're reading this, someone else is testing yetbet.io and realizing they found something real.  Don't let that someone be everyone else but you.

Pepecoin is a layer 1 cryptocurrency. It is its own independent blockchain. Pepecoin was created from Dogecoin. Dogecoin was chosen for a few reasons.  1. It is under active development. 2. It has merged mining support. This will allow the Pepecoin network to take advantage of the 800TH/s securing the Litecoin and Dogecoin networks. 3. We wanted to bring the Dogecoin and Pepecoin communities together, and what better way to do this than by making Pepecoin from Dogecoin. **We welcome all shibes to join our community!**  # ""Why was Pepecoin created?""  The crypto market has shown a strong desire for a Pepe themed cryptocurrency. Many ERC-20 tokens were made last year in an attempt to give the people Pepecoin. However, ERC-20 tokens can never truly create a free and open Pepe cryptocurrency. ERC-20 tokens use smart contracts, which introduce trust back into the decentralization of crypto.  The creators of Pepe-ERC20 infamously blacklisted an investor's wallet worth tens of millions at the peak of its value. Additionally, they dumped trillions of coins (of which, at the time of creation, they minted for themselves) causing a market crash. Only after they took advantage of investors did they revoke the contract.  From Ethereum dependence, to high fees, to blacklisting, to minting, to liquidity pools, ERC20 tokens give coin creators too much power over investors. When the Pepe-ERC20 creators dumped their dev tokens causing a crash, that was the last straw.  We began building a Pepecoin for the people, free from smart-contracts and centralized authority.  # Mining Rewards  |Block Range|Reward in Pepecoin| |:-|:-| || ||| |1-99,999|500,000| |100,000-199,999|250,000| |200,000-299,999|125,000| |300,000-399,999|62,500| |400,000-499,999|31,250| |500,000-599,999|15,625| |600,000+|10,000|  # Inflation Rate  Pepecoin has the same emission rate as Dogecoin, which means it's inflationary and encourages usage. Over time, Pepecoin's inflation rate will gradually decrease in terms of its percentage of the total supply. After the 600,000th block is mined, about 5.256 billion coins will be added each year, but as the total supply grows, this fixed annual addition represents a smaller percentage of the total supply each year, thereby reducing its inflationary impact.  # Official Communities  * Reddit: [](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepecoin/) * Discord: [pepecoin.org/discord](https://pepecoin.org/discord)  # Reddit Tip Bot  Pepecoin tipping is supported, not just on , but on ALL of Reddit!

This vision is realized through:      **Decentralized Governance and Utility**: peaq provides the infrastructure for machines to operate autonomously, offering services across various dimensions - from land-based vehicles to drones in the sky or even equipment in space. This not only decentralizes control but also democratizes access, aligning with the ethos of Web3 where users and machines can interact without intermediaries.      **Ecosystem Richness:** The ecosystem of peaq is vibrant, supporting over 30 projects with more than 850,000 devices connected. These projects range from energy management to mobility solutions, each designed to leverage the blockchain's capabilities to provide real-world services. This extensive network showcases peaq's commitment to not just theoretical blockchain potentials but actual, tangible applications.      Users can stake Bitget's BGB or USDT to earn from a reward pool of 12,125,000 PEAQ tokens. This initiative not only incentivizes early adoption but also spreads awareness and investment in peaq's technology. The event runs from November 12 to November 19, 2024, offering a tangible way for crypto users to engage with peaq's ecosystem.      peaq is not merely participating in the blockchain revolution; it's leading a charge towards a new paradigm of physical and digital integration. what's your thought on the project Growth ?

This meticulous documentation affords me a substantial analytical edge in understanding market trends.      Based on my daily analysis, it appears that the predominant factor currently influencing Bitcoin's price trajectory is linked to political events, notably the anticipation of a Trump victory. There are also indications from U.S. government discussions about strategic shifts in economic policy, suggesting divestment from gold to potentially invest in Bitcoin, which could significantly alter market dynamics.      In light of these developments, I will be executing my trading strategies on the Bitget platform, where I aim to benefit from their promotional event offering a 250k DOGE airdrop.

Altcoin,An Unorthodox Wanted Ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1fku2wt/an_unorthodox_wanted_ad/,9/19/2024,18,"This post is exactly what it says as the Wanted Ad is not traditional, BUT it is surely in the right subreddits. It may not be an ad for some people, but I do think my epiphany applies to humans, especially those seeking self improvement. This is especially true if you desire something bigger for your social media footprint.  Overall, to help others improve I would strongly encourage people to find passion/motivation and find a community to support you and lift you up. There is nothing unorthodox about this suggestion. In order to be transparent I want to share that I found both in the most unlikely place and hearing others say how this community has changed the trajectory of their lives for three and a half months now encouraged me to make this post and find the right subreddit to share it. (post was originally for a different audience though wasn’t sure if that was allowed and never heard back from mods)  \*Full Disclosure:\* I have a full time career that I really do love and enjoy. I think I am making a difference in the world and to me that is crucial, BUT this isn’t the community that I am talking about.   The place that I am suggesting is a memecoin crypto currency community that is organically built and filled with real people from all around the world. If I still have your attention I am going to dig into my why of the Kendu Community and how this could be a path for many people to work on improving their own lives and better themselves in ways they likely would not have imagined. Overall, I am not even suggesting for the main body of this post that you need to buy Kendu and become a holder. You could join the community and work alongside others to help with brand awareness and be lauded as a Legend and a real Chad or Chadette in the community. Buying in does give that extra motivation and inspiration as the idea of working for one’s bag is something big in this crypto project. Being this post is for memecoin/crypto subs, seems a bit silly to suggest not having a bag, but one must do their own actual research and reading.   There is still a wealth of resources available to learn about Kendu, so you don’t get duped when you hear some one month old account say that Miazaki got scammed twice or you hear that he is going to make a cat coin (yes the recent Spaces are not recorded anymore, but you can join one and step up and ask the questions yourself. Miazaki welcomes new speakers) or you read that same one month old account say that he is going to use Chads funds for naughty things (he did say this and he did not mean it, but the uninitiated would be easily duped). Go back and Listen to the Dev Spaces and Community Spaces here: [https://www.youtube.com/@KenduInuArmy](https://www.youtube.com/@KenduInuArmy)  [ -Edavi Jewelry \(9\/1\/24 2:18pm EST\)](https://preview.redd.it/lialxuv3rtpd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f91fff1542cc8d3b9e34e6c7ddb74e06c59302e)  # **Direction and Drive**  Thinking about the fun and the testimonials from members really motivated me to make this post. People in the Telegram are all moving in the same direction. The goal is to promote and grow the brand into an international success story like SHIB and DOGE have done in the past for Crypto. People are all invested (I said you don’t even have to buy in, but naturally changing their financial standing is what has motivated everyone. Everyone must have goals and being invested creates its own inherent goal for each individual and goals are crucial to self improvement) and the shared vision makes it really easy to rally around the work that is done.   For me I have willingly written multiple Reddit articles, made my first memes, spearheaded  work with StockTwits to grow our presence on that platform and make sure the platform actually worked for us, I have even done massive bike rides (I am much healthier for this aspect of my Kendu ‘work’) around a major city and my local area to place stickers to raise brand awareness,  andI have  even taken my X account from a single account I followed for crypto TA to one that I use for Kendu extensively (blue check mark soon). I haven’t felt this passionate about something in a long long time.  Here are a couple testimonials that really support the realization I had about this community and how it can help the right person to improve themself while channeling their passions and having fun.  [This Chad joined just a bit before I did, but his impact on the community has been monumental. He is a representation of what is really awesome about humanity in so many ways!](https://preview.redd.it/0s9ye7jzqtpd1.jpg?width=1189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69036f45bdeffb5279f6f5a6b85fcd8e17f5a294)    https://preview.redd.it/ww6g6zpxqtpd1.jpg?width=1189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8576ba91f91866927b428d2ad4bac24ff7963c57  I listened to a number of members come up on the X Spaces and talk about what life was like before Kendu for them and it is fascinating the impact that Kendu has had on so many people. The Developer during X Spaces even encourages new faces to come up and speak ALL THE TIME. He really wants this to happen and it is a tremendously empowering thing to overcome a fear and get up on an X Space (no one can see your face which is really nice for many) and then come back to the Telegram to members complimenting you for overcoming your fear or how well you sounded. This is a place of acceptance and one that provides plenty of opportunities for us to put ourselves in situations to be a little uncomfortable  u/GoodWillShills on X said the other day (Kendu Loyalist and a really great human):   [CT \(crypto twitter\) is the worst tbhIts going to turn normies to look for a community that they can be accepted in…](https://preview.redd.it/ds8lqxjvqtpd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=14846b9387116258fda776b1a9675aa0fcc85a0e)  # **Leverage your Passions to Grow the Brand**   Kendu is an original IP,  but the developer, Kendu Miazaki, doesn't care what you do with the brand. He doesn't own it and if  you want to put KENDU in your video game, make merch, start an energy drink, whatever the community has the freedom to do so. Just don’t double dip. For example There are Kendu shirts on the Merch store and on Amazon now. Clothing is set, but maybe you can make a line of Kendu shoes cause that is your passion. You already have a built in clientele for your product and the community WILL support you!  [Being shipped now and ready for regular ordering I believe](https://preview.redd.it/cnyuirgsqtpd1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffcaea26d8e578d17e4ee4b33bb7b52b20bda7b8)  People have the freedom to do what they want and it is empowering to leverage your own passion with the common goal of growing the brand which in turn can help change one’s financial status. A community member started the merch store around 1 million market cap and Miazaki has spoken publicly that he doesn’t have time for that and is happy for others to be leaders.  One member is a jewelry maker and he  has created (I think it is almost completely done) a Kendu pendant template. Which he can sell to pay for his hard work. Maybe he will take the profits and put it back into the chart or not, but that doesn’t matter. If you have a great product you want to take to market and you want to use the Kendu brand and are an active member of the community (this is the key, don’t join the telegram and start pitching ideas or your product as it will go really poorly for you) you will have the support of over 10K TG members and over 14K holders.   https://preview.redd.it/6xgnpopqqtpd1.jpg?width=1189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcf8adbcac894dec4ca53f4d044743e6a6384dc7  If you really want to grow a YouTube or Tik Tok presence you could easily do so with the support of a strong community thru Kendu content. Take a look at my account. It is saturated with Kendu content mainly and my Karma has grown exponentially because I am as active as I can be. I went from like 5K karma to almost 30K karma now. I will assure you I do not care about that stuff, but it was a nice surprise and one I never thought about.  # **Fun**  This whole idea started because my kids were back to school and I was back to work and things were crazy busy. My body was low on sleep and energy and yet I couldn't resist the pull to jump into the Kendu Telegram to check in and do at least one post. I had an absolute blast in the TG that night. There are a wealth of personalities that exist. We have members from all over the world including: Australia, Denmark, England, Ireland, Germany, Thailand, India, USA (all over), Ghana, Brazil, and Netherlands to name a few. At this point the Telegram has even grown various sub groups with varying interests. Much of the Telegram is hyper focused on sharing to socials and shilling Kendu, but there are certain periods in the course of a day where more hanging out and off topic conversations can and do happen (limited, but true). Another aspect of fun that will inevitably happen is deeper connections are formed  as you are shilling, leveraging your passions. This gives room for side conversations with individuals that you have grown stronger bonds with. While the main Telegram is for work and spreading the brand you will be able to grow strong relationships and connections with others. What is life without human interaction and friendship? Some of my favorite moments are when I am in the Telegram and someone joins who clearly considers themselves an influencer or KOL and said person is looking for Kendu to pay them for promotion services. This is NOT what we do and we do not take kindly to such requests. Watching the community pile onto that person, who clearly did not research about the Kendu whey, is hilarious. YouTube raids are a great joy too and I have really been impressed with the community showing on various crypto focused X Spaces.  \*Background on the Coin:\* Currently there are 10497 members in the TG to support and encourage your growth of the brand. The community has grown organically without paying for KOLs, influencers or any fake upvotes or increases in traffic (it is a seedy world and it does happen for sure in Crypto, def other places too). We have members on all socials/Platforms (Reddit, X, TikTok (need growth), Instagram (need growth), YouTube, and StockTwits. Kendu is an original IP and is the developers last project ever.  If you want to learn more you can find the official Kendu reddit page in my profile (Not breaking the rules cause I can and do read).  If you see this as a path forward to self improvement for you, I encourage you to join the Telegram and lurk for a bit. If admin/Loyalist asks that you prove you are not a bot (bots join all the time and the filters will kick you out/ban you), then just politely tell them you are going to lurk for a bit to learn about the culture and community. I encourage all to lurk and learn about the community and decide what you can do. It has been a blast and has positively impacted so many people’s lives in meaningful ways.

If you haven't looked into it yet, you might be missing out!  Here’s why I’m bullish on Kendu:  1. Community-Driven Powerhouse: Kendu Inu isn’t just another random meme coin. The Kendu Chads community is growing fast, and they are serious about taking $KENDU to the next level. This isn't just hype—it's a strong, united group of holders committed to driving the project forward. Just check out the Kendu Inu Twitter page to see some of the wild things the community is doing.  2. Active and Transparent Dev Team: The devs behind Kendu Inu are incredibly active on social media and within the community, constantly working on new updates and improvements. Transparency is rare in crypto these days, but these guys are doing it right!  3. Potential for Explosive Growth: We’ve all seen what happened with DOGE and SHIB. When a meme coin gains a strong community and some actual utility, it can go parabolic. Kendu Inu is just getting started, and there’s a lot of room for growth.  TL;DR: If you’re sleeping on $KENDU, now might be the time to wake up. The potential is real, and I’m personally loading up while it’s still under the radar.

Like why is it that political events or world events cause the prices to drop suddenly? Or better yet, a high profile individual says something and seemingly in an instant the price goes up or down.  If crypto was truly decentralized, why is it so easily affected by what people or the media says? Why is it like the weather, where we have to forecast it? If it all just computer code, shouldn't it be predictable by the minute? If everyone is buying and holding, why does it suddenly decide to go up or down based off of what happens?

Altcoin,The Rise of $CATE: The Next Meme Revolution on the Ethereum Blockchain,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1fl7wtp/the_rise_of_cate_the_next_meme_revolution_on_the/,9/20/2024,2,"For over a decade, $DOGE has been at the forefront of the meme revolution, capturing the hearts of millions. But now, a new star is on the rise: $CATE. It's time to embrace the future, as $CATE steps into the spotlight, ready to become the largest and most vibrant community on the Ethereum blockchain. Are you ready to join the movement?  Let’s introduce you to the legendary CATE, the pioneering pet of Atsuko Sato fondly known as ""Kabosu Mama."" You may already know Kabosu, the Shiba Inu who became the face of the iconic Doge meme, but before the world fell in love with her, there was CATE. This trailblazing feline has always been a key part of the Sato household and is now ready to make its mark in the crypto space.  CATE isn’t just any cat. As the best friend of $DOGE, this legendary meme feline has stood by its side and now extends a paw of friendship to $NEIRO. With an adventurous spirit and irresistible charm, CATE has leaped onto the Ethereum blockchain, ready to leave its mark on crypto history. Can you feel the excitement?  And here’s the best part: $CATE is now officially listed on Bitget Exchange! To celebrate this huge milestone, Bitget is hosting a Candybomb event. This is your chance to get in on the action and claim your share of 1,920,000 $CATE.

Well toad, rabbit, cock, bull etc all tried but Cats and Dogs meme remain top community. The love for this two can be traced to the pioneering pet of Atsuko Sato (Cat and Dog), the dogs inspired Shiba inu and doge. Now, the Cats meme communities are pushing for the exposure of “Cate” known as the Kabosu Mama. They believe that CATE isn't just any cat but a legendary meme feline that has been the best friend to the famous $DOGE and now extends a paw of friendship to $NEIRO.  Currently, $CATE is trending after many top exchanges listed and many more like Bitget have scheduled it listing for 16th. I wonder if this might be the next doge or shiba but considering its tokenomic and total supply I think is worthy to add to watchlist. Also considering this is related to the Sato family will it become the top cat community meme?

Shiba, Doge, Pepe and recently Notcoin have all followed this part to ensure sustainability. This is why I feel there is something unique about Wuffi memecoin. The project aims to integrate gaming elements into its ecosystem and give users an exciting experience. The token recently got exposure after Bitget and other exchanges listing. The vision of Wuffi incorporating play-to-earn mechanism, NFT integrations, and potentially a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) position it as the frontrunner in the burgeoning GameFi sector.   The vision of blending gaming with blockchain technology is ambitious yet promising. By allowing players to earn $WUF tokens while enjoying interactive experiences, the project is creating a sustainable economic model. Additionally, the integration of NFTs can add a layer of ownership and collectability, enhancing the overall gaming experience and use case for the token.  This vision gives Wuffi the potential to redefine the GameFi and meme space. As the project continues to develop, it will be interesting to see how Wuffi evolves and whether it can live up to its ambitious goals. The price trend after listing is another feature to watch out.

If history repeats itself, DOGE could hit $1.10 within weeks.    🐋 As always, whales are in the mix, though I'm a bit skeptical. Major investors reportedly accumulated over 1.4 billion DOGE in just 24 hours, possibly signaling growing confidence in the meme coin's future.    📈 They're also talking about indicators, but I'm curious to hear from experts! A doji candle on the weekly chart and other signals hint at a possible trend reversal.    One more thing – there are rumors about a potential spot ETF for Dogecoin. Experts estimate a 75% chance of approval, which could significantly boost demand for the coin.    Currently, DOGE is trading at $0.1739, down 2.1% over the past 24 hours.

Here are some pieces of evidence that tell me it's 99.99999999% a scam (possible rug-pull), and I want to warn people to think carefully if they want to invest in this coins during the current crypto hype.  Given the amount of media attention, it's a bit suspicious that media and portals (and youtube channels like claybro) are writing about and hyping the popularity of these memecoins. Don't remember that any other memecoin had that hype.   When you look at the websites of the mentioned coins, $PEPU, $STARS, $DOGE², $FLOCK, they all have similar graphics, which is first red flag.

Kendu is listed on over 14 exchanges.  \* Despite market downturns, we've grown to over 12,000 holders and continue to grow steadily.  \* In June, Kendu was the top gainer according to Crypto Research (\[https://x.com/CryptoRResearch/status/1808513629815447683/photo/1\](https://x.com/CryptoRResearch/status/1808513629815447683/photo/1)), proving our strategy works.    Now is a great time to buy Kendu. After doing your own research (DYOR), there's no reason not to get involved.

A lot of new coins look interesting but mostly after a pump and dump by the team or jeeters leave us, the normal people and investors, with empty hands behind. Out of those coins that are there for a longer time you still have a lot of options and still hard to make the right, often very personal, choice.  For me personally, after seeing **$VoteDoge** already a few months ago, I got convinced that this is the right choice for me. **$VoteDoge exists for more than 5 months and is nicely playing the upcoming elections** but clearly also one of his kind.  Since $VoteDoge is not associated with any of the parties or political persons, it can run the elections on own strengths and the character can, next to the elections in the United States, connect to any other election as well as take a presidential view on any other theme. For this reason I am convinced $VoteDoge is here to stay during the elections bug also forever after!  Another aspect is **the strong community supporting $VoteDoge**, very engaged, fun to be part of and determined to make VoteDoge a success. Which other community has been this visible with real life campaigns already with this relatively low market cap?  Also in the upcoming week a mobile billboard truck promoting $VoteDoge at the democratic National Convention in Chicago has been planned for and more is yet to come !  For me it is clear: **$VoteDoge is a clear HODL**. $VoteDoge will be successful!  In case you still need to get convinced, I can only advise to do your own research by checking out the votedogechat group at telegram, the Votedoge.com website and @Votedoge on twitter.

But what a week when we look back as VoteDoge community!  Earlier this week VoteDoge got confronted with a copycat that came from nowhere and hit 1B MC in hours. Soon even 13 other copycats where seen. These are the moments that show you what a community really is and shows the strengths of a real one. The community gathered and decided together not to stay back and immediately agreed that this was the time for a big marketing push organized on the spot amongst ourselves.  In minutes enough money was donated by the community and team to push our volume, increase exposure and to fund a campaign for all that contributed to the marketing wallet. Great moments that bring a strong team together! Moments that show what a real crypto community should be.  And this is not the first time for VoteDoge to show the strength and resilience of the community and team. The same happened some weeks ago when a big part of the original Dev team left and dumped their bags. VoteDoge dropped to a MC of 20K but the community together with remaining part of the former OG team and active new joiners took control and brought it back to 200K in less than 24 hours.  The first ever Democratic Take-Over (DTO) was born.  **This is what the VoteDoge community is, at VoteDoge we are all Devs!** We build the plans together, step in and make it happen as a strong, united team. Honesty and transparency is what we stand for, bringing a change in crypto world. We are not just a bunch of individuals, but a strong VoteDoge team! And I am not even speaking about the great things and real life campaigns that have been done and organized by community members before. Which other community ever organized for a plane banner above a presidential debate, mobile billboards at both parties national Conventions etc.?  **Curious? Take a peek in our VoteDogechat group on telegram.** You will realize that it is fun to be part of a real, honest and active community, willing to work for their bags and willing to wait in order take some profits in a responsible way when the opportunity arises in future.

Presidential candidates calling each other fascists, bigots and threats to democracy.  Here a **VoteDoge**, we don't play that way.  VoteDoge is all about creating an inclusive atmosphere, where right-wingers, left-wingers and centre oriented people (and dogs of course) can discuss, chat and just have a jolly good time.  We laugh together, share dope memes, talk about current affairs, all while maintaining a good mood and discourse.  We had a great debate watch-along where a lot of people chimed in.  The statements made on Eating Dogs and Cats were hilarious and of course hitting bullseye for a memecoin like Vote**Dog**e!  Looking at Trump's latest comments, there's a big chance another debate might be on the horizon soon.

MemeCoins,"VoteDoge, The Political Memecoin that Survives Election Chaos!",https://i.redd.it/pwqj8wybpxyd1.png,11/4/2024,4,"Election Day is almost here, and with it, an absolute storm for political coins everywhere.  By tomorrow, November 5th, the market will likely see a massive shakeup as coins tied to specific candidates or parties plummet if their side loses.  Many political coins are taking a huge risk tied to one candidate’s win, meaning they could crash hard overnight.  **But not VoteDoge!**  Unlike those coins, VoteDoge is completely independent and here to stay, no matter who takes office.  While other coins face the threat of wiping out depending on results, VoteDoge keeps rising with the election hype and continues its satirical journey well beyond U.S. politics.  We’re not tied to any candidate or party; we’re here for the memes, for the long haul, and we’re going global.  Think of it: after the U.S. election, VoteDoge takes on the world stage with major elections like Canada and Germany in 2025. From Trudeau to Scholz, no politician is safe from VoteDoge’s satire.  This coin is set to bring meme culture and laughs across borders, targeting political figures around the globe and keeping the hype alive far beyond the U.S. election.  **Why Buy Now?** The floor’s currently around $30-40K, but with enough support, VoteDoge has the potential to skyrocket.  The election hype right now is at an all-time high, and it’s only the beginning. Take a ride up with VoteDoge towards inauguration and international elections; early investors stand to gain big.  Don’t miss your chance to be part of a global movement! Get in now, while the market is prime, and help us take VoteDoge to the next level! As shown before a few big buys will make VoteDoge skyrocket and all eyes on VoteDoge jump in!  #Buy VoteDoge!  **$VoteDoge Contract Address:** 98ZmjtNLjTr1yih6D7fdFm8ViU1jEYDcBU1wjc2k9imVX  X: realvotedoge   Telegram: realvotedoge   Instagram: realvotedoge   TikTok: realvotedoge","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/OreSupply - r/SolanaNFT  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

MemeCoins,"VoteDoge...making a New, Refreshing Start!",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fzxlh7,10/9/2024,7,"By now most of you for sure know **VoteDoge**; the political memecoin that is making waves for over 6 months and running it's own independent campaign, not connected to any political candidate, party or even country. A strong focus of course was and is still seen to play on the US elections but it ain't stop there.  Like any campaign and presidential candidate also VoteDoge had good and bad times. After a strong start and riding the memecoin hype to an ATH of 2.8M MC, we had a correction. Jeeters entered and left, leaving their trails in the chart. The real test came when part of the original dev team left and rugged the community. We touched a low of 20K but recovered in less than 24 hours to 250K. This showed the determination, resilience and strength of the community and the remaining team.  Copycats entered which shows that Votedoge is seen and a terrific meme with a strong potential towards the elections. Yesterday another, I would almost say, murder attempt was done on VoteDoge. Big whales that were 'helping us' dumped on us even taking a team member along.   This is what crypto world seems to be; a bunch of unreliable individuals, hunting down their own personal benefit only.  VoteDoge and it's team is different and want in no way to be compared with others and other coins that are there for the quick gain, those that rug and leave the normal people behind with losses. We are transparent, open and act in full transparency and honesty with our community.  Yesterday's attack failed, the dip was bought, mostly in the hands of strong believers, community members that love and care for the meme. Like in real politics and campaigns,  VoteDoge only came out stronger and it's community is even more determined than ever.  **VoteDoge is there and ain't leaving! We will play the US elections but really position the meme as a crypto president of the United World.** An updated roadmap will be published soon.  **Join us on the new and updated socials for this new and refreshing start!

MemeCoins,"VoteDoge update, in case you missed it!",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fbdwg2,9/7/2024,6,"VoteDoge had a rollercoaster ride in the last week. Part of the former DEV team left and sold off their coins...you could almost say we were really f*cked or rugged by them.  But the community and part of the team that was still there stepped up and took full control over VoteDoge. **This is what you call a real DTO, a Democratic Take Over**! As a result VoteDoge dipped initially but was immediately bought up again by clever new joiners that were eagerly waiting for a better moment to buy in and recovered strongly within the next 24 hours. This shows the resilience, strength and determination of the community as well as the strength and potential of the coin!  VoteDoge is way more than it’s leader.  It’s way more than it’s team.  It’s a community.  It’s an idea. It’s a movement.  In the coming period you can expect a lot and this will not be restricted by 'playing' the united states elections only. VoteDoge will go even more global than seen today!  We will continue to go out on the street and visit the real life community. However, as a crypto president in-the-making, VoteDoge will not ignore the US elections and present himself as the better alternative, the alternative for those that recognize the political dissidence and strive for freedom and independent thought.  You have seen a lot by us already; - a plane banner flying above the first presidential debate in Atlanta - billboards in a.o Vegas - mobile truck billboards on the street during the Republican as well as Democratic National Convention  - meeting at the Big Ben in London - community campaigns and challenges  - X spaces - a great CGI video; https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoinmoonshots/s/5wvIIh57n3  Way more is in the making and to come! We are not yet going to relief it now, but you will be surprised!  VoteDoge will be seen and is convinced that organic growth is the way to go! We will do this on the strength and actions of the community, people who believe in the  VoteDoge project and are invested themselves. Since we are a real DTO now, and will be a successful one, you can expect some rebranding going forward. But no doubt: we will remain strong as ever, active as ever!  Curious? Join us on VoteDogechat on TG and trust me ...you will buy in after!

If you're holding DOGE, SOL, or others, you've probably seen some solid profits lately.  DOGE is going on a rise of 0.404$ and I got a feeling that it's gonna hit 0.5$ anytime soon  https://preview.redd.it/cpbwek7y6m3e1.png?width=1115&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce69a053bde7af130e3f255bf480a675e58ac35b  With that in mind, I’m thinking of trading DOGE in the Diamond Thursday event. Since the market is in a good spot, it's a great way to keep reaping profits while participating. Bitget runs this event every Thursday with 400K DOGE in rewards, so it seems like a good opportunity to trade while things are positive. You can join the event if you want to trade DOGE and make your trading volume on the event on the spot.  And Speaking of price, I think anything’s possible as long as the market continues in the right direction.

MemeCoins,The first polls are out...Where is VoteDoge?,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fxgd0n,10/6/2024,3,"The election season in the United States is really heating up, and both candidates are very active, getting seen at their rallies and campaigns across the country. With less than a month to go, it's crunch time to convince the folks out there to vote for one of them.  **More than six months ago, when VoteDoge started, there was a fear that VoteDoge would overtake the elections** and get more votes than any of the other candidates. A lot has changed since then.  Biden dropped out of the race... or better, you could almost say he was pushed out since the group behind him lost faith.  Something similar happened to VoteDoge!  After reaching an ATH of 2.8M and subsequent correction, the campaign team (read: original Devs) stepped out of the race and rugged the community. However, the community showed their strength and resilience, resulting in a recovery from 20k to over 250K in less than a day. Part of the original team, extended with some other community members, took control and started to prepare plans for a strong comeback in the election race.  Not having the power of a campaign team and funds like Kamala, this unfortunately takes a bit longer than expected... but you will see a strong revival!  A lot is being worked on behind the scenes, and VoteDoge will enter the last part of the campaign stronger than ever!   **Polls have been wrong before, and this time the final polls will still show VoteDoge as the winner of the elections!**  The 250M coins, representing the number of eligible voters, will be in the hands of a strong community of believers and HODLERs by then.  VoteDoge plans and roadmap are being redefined and in the making as we speak. VoteDoge will be more strongly positioned as the crypto candidate, the crypto president, of the whole world. People united; for the people, by the people! Contributing to society and charity while still making fun of politics, VoteDoge will become the political memecoin, uniting a community in raiding, fun, and nice chats.  **VoteDoge will be THE winner of the elections on November 5th!**  Curious?

MemeCoins,Is the new $doge a dog? ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1epgk8x,8/11/2024,4,"We all know that meme coins have been getting a lot of attention in the cryptocurrency space, and some may even compare it to the trend of NFTs that happened a few years ago.  Need I tell you the millionaires that Doge and Shiba Inu has created and in the process of owning the tokens and being behind those dogs, fellow mankind has had the chance to enter big communities and make lifelong friends.   A dog on a world domination mission However, with a lot of craze to the memecoin market, it has also become saturated in a way that it is very difficult to hold onto coins for much longer because one of two reasons:  Socials get deleted eventually and rugged. The owners of the socials, stop posting and keeping the page updated when the price dips. In a sense, owning a meme coin has become a challenge because you are too reliant on a centralised party to do their part.  This is why I believe wDog will be the next Doge. < $wDog stands for Wrapped Dog. Much like other crypto wrapped assets like wBTC/wETH, etc.   $wDog To begin with, these inherent risks are non existence because this beautiful dog’s twitter page is this: (see attached images)    What are you seeing? Well, it’s twitter itself and everyone is a creator and contributor to the feed as an open forum. Making it the first decentralised dog after a very long time.  The community does everything, and just a couple of hours before I did my part by writing this article, another probably anonymous member created a profile picture generator: https://www.makeyourwdog.xyz  and people have been getting creative with it   So I invite you to come and join us on the Solana blockchain, where we have taken a dog and wrapped it (as simple as that).

MemeCoins,$KENDU UPTREND - Compounding Moon effect,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1juax65/kendu_uptrend_compounding_moon_effect/,4/8/2025,84,"**The Compounding Moon Effect of $KENDU**  As some of you know, memecoins move up and down with the chain they are built on. We are used to see the dollar value of a coin, but in the background of this, it is actually tied to the price of the network that coin is built on. For example; $PEPE, $SHIB and $KENDU are built on top of the Ethereum network and therefore, if Ethereum goes up or down this moves the price of $PEPE, $SHIB and $KENDU as well.     **Current Trend $KENDU**  When you look at the current trend of $KENDU, it is looking very bright. The community went through a long consolidation period which we are finally breaking out of. The buying power becomes stronger and stronger.   When you take a look at the chart below, you see 2 lines. The blue line is the current price based in $ETH and the red line is the current price based in USD.   The blue line shows that there is a buying force of +150% over the last 3 months! You can clearly see where the community wants to go.  The red line shows the current price in USD. This line is up +16%. Because $ETH dropped -60% over the last 3 months the value in USD drops, but the value in Ethereum stays the same.     [In this chart you see the real-time price comparison of $KENDU in Ethereum and Dollar wise. ](https://preview.redd.it/moygndgn9lte1.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3334794363544b9f5e0e823ffd34648ba3750e3)     **Compounding Moon effect**  When Vitalik rolls out the PECTRA upgrade to Ethereum making the network faster/cheaper and when the FED will cut rates, people become more open towards risky assets such as $ETH. Let's say, $ETH climbs back up +25% to $2000, $KENDU will automatically jump up +25% and move up with Ethereum. This will create a crazy compound effect, because as you can see, $KENDU is being bought way more than it is sold ATM when you look at the current $KENDU / $ETH price chart.   I'd say, follow the money. The big money is buying Ethereum in the masses. It's the second biggest crypto asset. When Ethereum will start to gain momentum, $KENDU will follow and will follow HARD!  When this happens buying power will drive the price up as we can see right now and $ETH will only snowball this effect even more.  $KENDU is over 1 year old with a very strong community for its current $10 million marketcap. The all time high of $KENDU is $282 million and when you look at the biggest holders, almost no one sold during this time.  [Here is a small sheet comparison of the current holder distribution. ](https://preview.redd.it/ryf9w19sflte1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48e3cb6f93813549df9e426023803a71eb8e8428)     **What to look for in a Memecoin and why Kendu has that**  A community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto, if Shib, Doge and Pepe can accomplish the billions with far less money in the market, why can't Kendu. We are at the base of the biggest AltSeason in Crypto history, we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days, so why can't Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need by the 3 coins I have mentioned, so what's stopping Kendu???   Join the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.   Skip the Frappuccino and put the money into Kendu at the minimum.

MemeCoins,Life Changing Tidal Wave Starting to Build,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1ihu7r1/life_changing_tidal_wave_starting_to_build/,2/4/2025,120,"Everybody here knows that if you hit the right coin you could be sitting on an enormous pile of cash so big that it permanently changes your family line. In memecoins you can go from a corporate mill slave to a private island in a matter of days if you happen to be standing in the right spot when lightning strikes. That is why were are all here.  I am old enough to remember when Amazon was a penny stock bookstore back when buying things online was something new and risky. I remember when gold prices were $200/ounce and you had to buy it in person, at a store. I did not buy any Amazon because I thought bookstores were unprofitable, and I did not buy gold because my 1987 Corolla with popup lights threw an engine rod.   [These cars were cool once, and gold was $200\/ounce.](https://preview.redd.it/iraz6je0z6he1.png?width=1217&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e3548fba226768858d2b045a0c5d478210ffd62)  I remember when my friend asked me how to buy bitcoin and we went in together to buy a hundred of them for about $10 each. We sold out at $18 and patted ourselves on the back for 80% gains. We thought we were pretty smart. I also owned Nvidia in 2012 and sold it at a loss and thought that was smart.  I have watched waves build, crest, and crash, and I have seen waves build and build and build and just keep on building. I have ridden waves and timed them perfectly, I have bailed out early, held too long, and made every mistake there is and had enough success that I am someone people come to for advice. I have had about equal success with my own business launches and my investments. Added up, I sit comfortably now. Last year my high school daughter won a stock market game, beating nearly 1000 other students across the nation. She did it by asking me what to buy, and then doing whatever she wanted, because she was 14, and smarter than me.  **What Now**  Right now all my money is in Kendu. There is nothing like it, and I believe basic market forces are going to make it a 1000X from where it sits today. If the community that is building this coin keeps its foot on the gas it could easily be twice that. Memecoins are not the same as the stock and metals markets where I have most of my experience, but they are similar, and if you have a trained and experienced eye, you at least know what to look for.   Kendu has marketers all over the world, and has dumped its founder who got greedy too soon. Most coins simply die at that point, but Kendu had already turned into a juggernaut and instead of dying, it just kept rolling, and actually gained steam. The community is stronger and bigger now than it was for its all time high, and has none of the built-in sabotage that handicapped it in the past. It is a rising wave that just keeps building and building. A tsunami on the open ocean is actually undetectable, but it builds as it travels and when it approaches the shoreline it suddenly crests upwards. This is also what happens with markets. All the forces roll together undetected until suddenly they are towering over everything.   We know memecoins can suddenly break out and go 10X in the course of an afternoon. We know some of them go into the decabillions every few years. We also know exactly what kinds of coins do this. There are thousands of coins that don't, and only a few that do. The winning profile is well-established at this point. You need a strong community that does its own marketing every single day, you need to grow every day, and you need to have several 90% dips that shake out all the weak ones and attract the types who will hold strong. That is what DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and all the other successful coins have done, and it is exactly what all the failed coins didn't do.  Kendu is doing all of the above and it is going to pop sooner or later. Honestly I would not be surprised if it pops later this evening, but I hope it holds out a little longer. The longer it builds, the higher it will rise.","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/MemecoinsOnSui - r/MemecoinMoonshots - r/SolanaNFT  Also check out the official discord for r/Memecoins: https://discord.gg/YM9sSDbsBh  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

MemeCoins,"I’ve been in Crypto since 2018, why Kendu Inu is the best All Star Meme Coin of this cycle",https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1e4qc69/ive_been_in_crypto_since_2018_why_kendu_inu_is/,7/16/2024,154,"Here is my story, I have been in crypto since the first alt coin cycle. Back then I was an idiot and didn’t understand market cap at all. I lost money on Tron and some other coins that never went anywhere. Since then I have been in and out of crypto. I joined a telegram group where I learned skills of how to trade, how to analyze charts and what to look for in coins going into a cycle.   This cycle I jumped into some base coins due to their tie to Coinbase, (Aerodrome) that led me to base memecoins. Then I realized they were all pump and dumps. But I knew everyone was looking for the next Doge and Shib. Lots of retail money are looking for those type of gains and want to find a memecoin early to make life changing money.   You have found it with Kendu Inu.   Dev was part of the Shib project.   The main holders are holding to 10 billion plus. Not to mention the holding % has been spread out dramatically over the last 6 weeks during this pullback. (Super bullish)  Dev has a plan and a goal to run this to 100 billion MC. Yes that sounds ridiculous. But when you start to dive into look at the tokenomics and how this plan can be reached you find the community.   The community is the difference. This community refuses to fail and shills anywhere and everywhere. They believe and are holding for long term gains. They aren’t looking for a 2x pump then selling. They are expecting 10 billion MC.   So to summarize, a Dev with a long term plan who has been a part of a memecoin that is one of the top 2 of all time. A community that refuses to fail. It has shown that it can rip 5x in a week. Holders going up organically. Zero bots and zero paid marketing to get an influencer pump and dump.   We were just getting started. Through the dump out of last month, holders constantly went upwards. This is the token you want when ETH and BTC break their ATH and run. Kendu will get 10 billion + MC. 100 billion isn’t all that crazy when you look at it.   Do your own research, you will ape in.","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/JupiterExchange - r/OreSupply - r/SolanaNFT  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

MemeCoins,An honest story about a average young male buying his first house with Memecoin profits!,https://i.redd.it/lxw8plr9x83e1.jpeg,11/26/2024,216,"Hey guys, I have been writing Reddit posts more often since I started my memecoin Journey in March this year. I try to make relatable posts for normal investors and I try to be as honest as possible.   First some background, Im in my 20’s and living with my parents in Europe. Im working in heatlhcare and I have got a average salary. My Girlfriend and I are looking to buy a house together but its absolutely impossible where I live without bringing a big bag of money.   This is where $Hege came into my life. I have been buying/holding/trading Cryptocurrency since 2017. Never had the right budget/knowledge/mindset to really make money. Yes I was early on coins like Verge/Litecoin/Doge/Shiba and several others but was never able to hold untill the moonshot. Im afraid to look back at my past since I have had the change to be a millionair more then twice if I just held…   In April I started investing in $Hege, started with a 35 dollar buy. I slowly increased my bag. I have traded and DCA’d my way up to 2 million tokens in 7 months. I have been holding on to my investment and I have been working for it to! I have made countless Reddit posts, done 1000’s of raids and I came up with several competitions to engage the community.   My total investment in $Hege was 7500 Dollars in the course of 7 months. If my GF and I want to buy a house we need to bring 100.000$ total. For us to work this together it would take us over 5 years each before getting close while living on small money.   As we speak Hege dipped back to a market cap of 22 million after an insane price surge towards a ATH of 31 million. My bag is worth over 50% of a future house. And all of this in the course of 7 months. We all know the Bullrun is just getting started and so is $Hege.   Hege is getting listed on AscendEX this week and the team is announcing a even bigger CEX this week. When the market picks up and bounces I expect Hege to run to a new ATH very soon!   Some people might have seen previous posts I did, in my latest one from a couple weeks ago I stated Hege would hit a new ATH after I got some inside info. Well it happened.   I am not planning on selling my whole Hege bag when I see 100.000$ in my wallet. I know Hege has potential to reach 100 mil market cap this year. I expect it to go well into the hundred millions next year since the team is always performing and the community is growing rapidly. The 100.000$ will be small compared tot he potential of $Hege.    After fading and selling DOGE/SHIBA/TRON/VERGE and others to early it wont happen to my ever again!   I will proudly show you guys our first House bought with gains from HEGECOIN, and remember to always DCA in and DCA out!  https://linktr.ee/hegefund","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/OreSupply - r/SolanaNFT  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

MemeCoins,Be careful $NEIRO ETH is heading for a collapse ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1f5maox,8/31/2024,72,"Be careful  @NeiroOnEthereum  is heading for a very sizable collapse.   Most of the buys and sells on the LP pools are mev bots extracting bounces on the way down. Pumping in and dumping off.   Then there is the KOLs selling still. Several of which are now out but still many to go. But they’ve left properly supporting the token due to fears of legal challenges, insider trading and wash trading.   The token is fraught with botted comments, likes and votes. As well as holder counts. Making it similar to a Ponzi scheme. Which we know collapse hard and fast.   The token needs constant supply of new holders to make up for wash trading and sell offs. Any pump that comes now will be followed by a HUGE dump as the team now struggles with death threats, huge amounts of people with almost complete losses and legal issues.   It’s lost its market maker wintermute who took a 50% loss. They’ve lost many VC deals. And there is still rumours that there is a legal case forming against bybit due to insider trading and a delisting is imminent. Bybit has been caught doing this before and lost its license in Hong Kong. Uk and USA. The question is now. Keep your license. Or dump a token. What do you believe they will do?   You must remember that with only $600,000 of LP on a $60m token only a dump of a few percent can see the entire LP pool withdrawn.   The top KOLs kook, solstice, pro the doge have all left and sold their allocations and a tweet of support from Crash saw an almost 30-40% dump. They continue to tweet as to save face. But they must remain careful now as the online sentiment is overly hostile towards them.   The selling has not stopped. With the team continuing to dump their bags. Truly the biggest scam of this cycle.   I have warned you the bottom is not in multiple times. The bottom is not in until it hits 0. This token will never list on a top tier 1 again. Bybit did not do due diligence.  @wintermute_t  vouched for the team and took a huge reputational and financial loss. Which is unfortunate because wintermute was known to be top tier. But sadly is now more like gotbit in reputation.   If you see a Green Day. Just be sure that a huge red day will follow and it will take you out with it.   The only way to recover to $300m is to give supply to KOLs who will dump it again. And the more money the scam team speaks of holders money. The worse the legal ramifications are.   We know this is the developer of ponke and a few others. So far I have not listed their twitters. But it’s not hard to find.   @Shibtoken  has not yet publicly apologised to holders who they allowed to be caught up in this scam. But it’s not a good look and has caused huge damage to their company image.   This is the biggest scam and it’s sadly called $NEIRO.","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/OreSupply - r/SolanaNFT  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

MemeCoins,Memecoins will be huge | Hege should your play,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1eafk89/memecoins_will_be_huge_hege_should_your_play/,7/23/2024,86,"## The Memecoin Era has Arrived  In a recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1dzlsa3/hege_why_i_bet_big_on_this_project/), I made the case for why this is the Memecoin supercycle.  In short, I argued that this is the age memecoins explode to dominate cryptocurrency.  Not all projects will be successful. In fact, virtually all tokens are dead. According to BDC Consulting, between 40,000 and 100,000 memecoins are created daily. As you can imagine, the outlook is grim. At the time of their report in March 2024, only 1000 memecoin projects were liquid.  The simple truth is that most people lose money on memecoins. The average investor treading into this market serves as exit liquidity. Some fall for pump-and-dump schemes. Most play it safe and join a project too late, or exit their positions at the wrong time.  There's little question that the Memecoin world is a minefield. Yet, the lure of the memecoin remains, and for good reason: Memecoins are a proven vehicle. Doge and Shiba paved the way, yet many more projects have emerged to reinforce the viability of Memecoins. If you're reading this, you're probably here because the likes of Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat convinced you the next promising project is out there. It used to be difficult to crack the top one hundred tokens by market value, but that isn't the case anymore.  A big factor in this success is the rise of Decentralized exchanges. Gone is the requirement to put forward vast sums of capital for centralized exchanges. As a result, exchanges have exploded in popularity. At the start of 2020, just 90,000 people were using a DEX. By the end of 2022, 6.6 million were on at least one DEX according to a paper in the Journal of Corporate Finance.  As these technical and capital barriers fall, a project's success now rests with its community. Only two questions remain:  Is it the right time and what projects?  To start, let's step back and update where we are in the crypto market cycle.  If past trends hold, we are in year three of the cycle and the final weeks of the traditional summer lull. BTC tends to start climbing again in the fall as the supply faces deflationary pressure and people return from their summer vacations. The positive headlines then hit the news, people notice, and a bull run begins the following year as roughly outlined in green.  https://preview.redd.it/9iwyhb1ecbed1.jpg?width=1293&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57f069053a0babdb0d5bd6b1e830c12d54bccc86  Why does this matter? Well, the total market capitalization of the memecoin space is directly correlated to the price of Bitcoin.  https://preview.redd.it/0v37jirccbed1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=05b67eba1c652db778fd1b3b2ae2a83ce72a2761  Given previous trends, we can expect a strong fall season for Memecoins. According to a recent CoinGeeko survey, the market generally agrees.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/mxhdpe6bcbed1.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb3bf88d0e2f6cd9767405c5f2601323f47ee78  Can a memecoin project have a realistic shot at a billion-dollar valuation? In 2023, I'd say, no. Things have shifted since. In 2024, it's clear that the answer is a resounding yes!  https://preview.redd.it/tn6u8on9cbed1.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c5547ea4d21bc5e8a3dc9d2ef89b8a9c765bb90  &#x200B;  [ Meme Coins Were the most popular narrative in 2024 Q2, accounting for 14.3&#37; market share. ](https://preview.redd.it/3cuqklq6cbed1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=781d52868bc34f235a5533fe4352d96d26c93367)  &#x200B;  [ With this opportunity, creators are launching more projects than ever before. ](https://preview.redd.it/0cg7tdn4cbed1.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=aac7ded52d6af031fc64c9e35f1a16ccfffdccc6)  &#x200B;  [Speculators and investors are taking note.](https://preview.redd.it/318kizxubbed1.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=7beab7294822ea9442429837cb3e08bec2b935af)  &#x200B;  [Rising interest can be seen in the general public.](https://preview.redd.it/s3479lxpbbed1.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf0900ded4149acb60400debd55546388ab46c21)  Okay, so I have you convinced that memecoins are hot commodities in the approaching bull run. How high can they go in a bull run?  The answer: Face-melting high. It's hard to wrap your head around this. Let's look at one of the most successful Solana projects of this cycle so far: DogWifHat (WIF).  [Memecoins can be explosive once a bull market hits.](https://preview.redd.it/cxh5kg4mbbed1.png?width=1424&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecac3ae4afacd74246469c71fbfe49a9620567d3)  If you had bought $1000 worth of DogWifHat in the first couple weeks of January, you would have $15,000 today or a return of 1420% in six months. That's assuming you didn't sell before the summer lull. If you did, you could have captured a cool $27,170!  What makes this return all the more impressive is that it was achieved in a strong growth phase of the market, but historical trends indicate that the actual bull market is still ahead. Now here is where things get crazy. In the 2021 bull run, Shiba Inu achieved 8766005% growth as measured from its introductory price to its maximum market capitalization. Yes, that is not an error. Had you invested $1000 and sold at the top you would have 87.6 million dollars!  While it's unlikely anyone captured this value, success stories in memecoins are real. I'm sure you'd agree that capturing even a fraction of this wealth would constitute life-changing returns.  Sure, you could buy $WIF or Doge today. However, you aren't on these forums for mature tokens that might give you 2-10x returns. You are here because you want a winning project that will net you 30x or 100x.  Am I going to sell you a token? Absolutely. I believe one of those projects exists right now, and that project is Hege.  https://preview.redd.it/m0iaxsljbbed1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=055f6bb274b56c6f917db556e06db7fef7465658  ## Key Metrics  Project age: 3 months  * Market cap: 13M * Holders: 7400 * ATH: 30M * Supply: 1B * CEXs: Azbit, Toobit, Indoex, Superex BitMart, MEXC (***new listing today!***) * Solana token (quicker transactions and lower fees than ETH-based projects). * Freeze and mint authority revoked.

[MEXC is a big player.](https://preview.redd.it/6fbtj91fbbed1.png?width=2243&format=png&auto=webp&s=b21df91545b1c392bfdd1c8322343795f73bb3b0)  ## Makings of a Cult-Coin  Hege is not just another cute dog coin. Hege is tailor-made to position itself within the emerging world of crypto cult coins. To make this possible, Hege is a story-driven character. With each milestone, a chapter of his rise from nothing to financial and social fulfillment is unlocked.  The character art style is distinctive and easy for even novices to incorporate into art.  https://preview.redd.it/b1anumqbbbed1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=50bb36d950db6a886172b91f89d9aecc55257213  Of course, a project is only as strong as its development team. Luckily for Hege, he's got a dream team well-versed in graphics design, marketing, software Engineering, community management, entertainment, and financial services consulting. Check out the Hegecoin website or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SolanaMemeCoins/comments/1e7sqni/hege_a_deep_dive/) fantastic post for more details.  The results of their efforts are clear for all to see. 0-30M in five weeks, a very active Telegram community with 6000+ followers, six exchanges, and some of the best artwork in the memecoin industry.  [Recent Bladerunner animation by Heg Dev](https://reddit.com/link/1eafk89/video/prwaols7bbed1/player)  Best of all, the team understands the importance of harnessing their community to help grow the project. At any time, multiple contests are giving back to the community thousands of dollars worth of Hege. I myself have won $610 worth in just two weeks across three contests.  There are contests for meme creation, Reddit, Twitter, and TikTok, marketing. There's a sticker contest giving away an incredible $2000!  [Hege Sticker at Fenway Park, Boston. Courtesy of Cine.](https://i.redd.it/3s32is53bbed1.gif)  As you can imagine, this has galvanized the community to throw themselves into growing Hege. Not only are people creating art and marketing, but they are donating in big ways. For example, the community contributed $140,000 to the CEX budget in just two weeks!  This incredible investment is working to bind individuals together in a shared sense that they are building a movement.  What's more, the marketing push continues to ramp up. Today, J C, a community member hired out a plane to fly a Hege banner over Los Angeles!  https://i.redd.it/g8eo5owzpced1.gif  ## Get in Now  Hege is shaping up to become something special. At just three months old and 13M market cap, Hege is a hidden gem. Its team is battle-tested and proven strong. A community is growing around the project. Best of all, it's early enough that your investment could potentially multiply by dozens or even hundreds of times in value. Hege is that 30x-100x you are looking for.  The time to lock in that potential is closing fast. The fall market is right around the corner. Investors will soon be piling into active projects. If you want to get in on this, don't wait, make a bold play on Hege now.  [Sexy man, that hege.](https://preview.redd.it/6qvzwunsabed1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=c804569288d2772b3536869d80cb13a22f985f63)  As always, do your own research and don't just take my word for it.

MemeCoins,The inevitable MLG respawn,https://i.redd.it/i4fzkcpj935f1.jpeg,6/5/2025,8,"Fellow Redditors,  Amid the countless PumpFun coins launching daily, I want to introduce you to a coin that represents one of the most iconic eras of internet culture: MLG.  It completes the trinity of meme culture:  - $DOGE = Internet Meme     DOGE, the most famous animal meme on the internet, reached a $90B market cap. Its creator, Billy, drew inspiration from MLG.  - $MLG = Internet Culture     The $MLG pixel glasses are the most iconic pair of glasses on the internet.  - $PEPE = Internet Symbol     PEPE remains the second-largest memecoin.  MLG pioneered these memes before they even became memes, shaping internet culture for decades.  - Just four months ago, under highly diluted market conditions, $MLG accounted for ~1% of all crypto interactions.     With over 100 million coins in existence, capturing 1% is significant—why? Because MLG’s mindshare is massive!  Many people resonate with this coin because it’s part of their identity. We saw this during its first peak. In the coming months, as more people enter the crypto space, most will be everyday folks—gamers, in particular. What will they gravitate toward first?  You can’t kill culture, and gaming culture unites the globe. 🌎  I won’t share a contract address here because I encourage you to research the project on X first. I’m not asking you to buy in unless you’re convinced.

With that in mind, we’d be stupid to not admit that memecoins are going to explode this bull market, which might be kicking off sooner than we think.   So, the new investors will arrive and what will they see? They’re going to see tonnes and tonnes of animals. I’m talking dogs, cats, hedgehogs, squid, horse dicks even??  Now, I’m not here to shit on anyone. But why would they think any individual one of these special? It is clear that animals have gained a lot of success, but why wouldn’t they just buy the best there already is (i.e., Doge). There will be a lot of success im sure, but will another animal really stand out?   Let me tell you what I think. What about something original that promises a once in a lifetime event that will blow up reels when captured on video? What about something that has the community too? What about something that has yet to flick the switch on their marketing whilst other projects are doing lots and stagnating?   Well, this is $Powsche coin.

Charity portal: the community is saving dogs by partnering with various charities. Finding homes and buying meals for the puppers.

MemeCoins,Lots of projects and teams were exposed this weekend. $PLATH continues to grow and shine.,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1i5wvz2/lots_of_projects_and_teams_were_exposed_this/,1/20/2025,25,"A lot of coins were exposed this weekend for the pump and dump chasers and paper handed teams that were behind them. Many projects are floundering and many will struggle to recover, **PLATH is already back over 1million market cap** and growing despite the trump dump. To put that in perspective. This time last week Plath were at around 6-700k market cap. The project saw the same chart volatility during the weekend as the entire market did - But this project navigates dips  The money coming out of these trump coins has to go somewhere. It’s only a matter of time. We've seen this before, albeit on a smaller scale, for example with GME and AMC coins a few months ago, that these fads create temporary hysteria but afterwards the market settles.  PLATH has shown over this weekend that they are one of the strongest teams at their market cap. Despite all the chaos none of their core team sold and many holders stood by them too because there is a belief in the project. Since then, buys have been flowing back in as people looked to capitalize on the temporary discount.  When the money does flow back into the market, and it will, people will be very curious about small market cap coins that showed teams and communities that held through this nonsense, and $PLATH really stands out in that category.  Entry right now around 1m market cap will be RARE, and will be deeply envied by future holders. If you want to be in a telegram bragging about buying in a 1m when the project pumps to unimaginable heights, this is your chance. We're still early here. The team are cooking up several bullish announcements whilst the market is recovering so that this project is primed to take off when this mess is over.  📍 Contract Address: 7wMutxpCdP3GbKaoMWoPVf2sFLCeV7a9ox25v1h2QsTp   💬 Telegram: @ PlathPortal  https://preview.redd.it/5jj5pih0r6ee1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a071983914bce3de9c3488df30f8f313763d7a5c  Join the telegram and see for yourself.

For Shiba, it was trading sideways until January 2021 and then it exploded and reached its peak at October 2021. For us, 10B is a milestone which I think would be achieved till May easily.   Remember, we are better than shib as our max coin supply is lesser than them which makes it a  more demanded project.

MemeCoins,$HEGE | Why I bet big on this project,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1dzlsa3/hege_why_i_bet_big_on_this_project/,7/10/2024,54,"&#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/9f32tj2g1mbd1.jpg?width=8088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cad1b4f3fa06341a7f5688ea3b6c6674a6c56908  Recently, I put down a big pot of money on a handful of projects.  I'll explain why I think this wager makes sense. Moreover, I'll detail why you should do it now, and why Hege should be one of, if not your biggest positions.  ## The Meme-coin Supercycle  Central to this gamble is my belief that this cryptocurrency market cycle will be explosive for meme-coins. A market cycle in crypto is often viewed in four-year spurts. In this view, Bitcoin acts as a kind of market bellwether. Every four years, BTC is programmed to undergo a reduction in mining awards known as the ""halving."" This event adds deflationary pressure to BTC. As the price slowly rises, the market takes note and attention returns to cryptocurrency. By year four, a full bull run begins. You can see that this pattern remains more or less consistent for three cycles, with the last one ending in 2021.  The 2020-21 period saw the mania around decentralized fiance and promises of real-world applications, particularly in the ETH ecosystem. Today, it's clear that the market feels let down by the promise of real-world applications. In the previous bull run, investments in tokens that portrayed themselves as serious projects like Cardano saw smaller returns compared to projects that were more fun like Shiba.  Investors know this. The stunning performance of meme tokens lines up with events in the broader markets. You can see it in the performance of Gamestop, Nvidia, or Tesla. The wild compensation packages of executives fit this narrative, as does the soaring costs of housing. Real or perceived, there's a growing sense that value is detached from traditional performance metrics. This creates a market zeitgeist of financial nihilism.  In short, you need to take bigger unconventional risks because that's the only way you'll ever be able to afford a good life. A return of 2-8% on your investments isn't good enough.  In this world, all that matters is narrative, community, and picking the right projects early.  Meme coins understand this worldview. These projects can feel more honest. Gone are the grandiose techno-babble promises. Meme coins understand that they are, at their core, fun, speculative vehicles. They won't change the world but might change your world.  These assets are now a proven vehicle for profit. Had you invested $100 USD into Shibu in its third month, you would be a multimillionaire today. You'd be a multimillionaire even after you slept through the 2022-2023 bear market where Shibu lost 90% of its value. Many meme tokens have since followed in its footsteps.  With the BTC halving behind us, we are in year three of the cycle. If historical trends hold up, the BTC price will start moving decisively upwards in the fall. Shib, for example, emerged in year three of the BTC cycle and became a market legend in the following bull run.  I believe now is the time to pick these winning projects for the next bull run.  ## Why Solana-based projects?  History often rhymes; even if it doesn't repeat. Now it's the Solana ecosystem's turn to emerge as a strong market force in 2025. Arguably, that's already happened.  It's arguably the top chain by transaction count. Even today, look at the added friction in buying something like Kendu versus Hege. Most got into Kendu via MetaMask in its early days, but Metamask requires workarounds to buy Solana projects. This is not the case for the most popular Solana wallet, Phantom. Likewise, buying SOL is cheaper than ETH, and transferring SOL off an exchange to your hot wallet is faster.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/jpxalndh1mbd1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbd9d2f13e4ee75814b0fb982cf75b7d5835dee5  This isn't to say ETH projects won't be successful, only that the Solana ecosystem is easier to access and better suited for meme-coin experimentation. As a Solana token, Hege will benefit from this newer network and alignment of historical trends.  ## Why Hege?  Central to Hege is the character Hege himself. He's a plucky, simple guy trying to make his way in a world where the odds are stacked against him. With each market cap milestone, another chapter in his story is unlocked. Hege's simple art style makes it easy for even novice artists to create memes.  The Hege developers understand that building a strong brand of memes and organic community building are the keys to success. To be truly successful in this space, they need to harness their community.  Harness their community they most certainly do! Contests are ongoing for the best meme artwork, the most active commentator, the best Reddit postings, and the best TikTok video. Contests can offer hundreds of dollars worth of Hege for the bigger prizes. There are frequently second and third-place prizes. Recently, there was a riddle contest to uncover the seed phrase for a wallet worth $1000 USD!  As a result, Hege's promotional content is everywhere on Reddit and increasingly showing a presence on Twitter. Rewards are given from the marketing fund, which is operated by the community itself and anyone who contributes has a say in the winner. The CEX fund alone had 140K in community donations in two weeks.  At times, the community is so strong that Hege feels like the early stages of a movement. This is a great sign for the project. Tesla showed signs of a cult of believers, and look at how well its stock performed. People who feel a sense of belonging and believe in a narrative of future potential invest big and are far less willing to walk away.  The results are undeniable. For example, Hege was added to six CEXs in two weeks, two of them today.  ## Key Metrics  * Project age: 3 months * Supply: 1B * CEXs: Azbit, Toobit, Indoex, Superex BitMart, MEXC * Market cap: 20M * Holders: 7,300 * ATH: 30M * Telegram members: 5,750 * Twitter followers: 10375  ## Is Hege a pump and dump?  I don't believe Hege has any likelihood of becoming a pump-and-dump scheme. Here are the reasons:  **Good token fundamentals.** Freeze and mint authority revoked. LP tokens burned. No honeypot and no tax. Locked liquidity pool of 1.1M.  **Good distribution.** The top holder owns only 4% of the supply.  **A culture of long-term holders.** The top holder has not sold any of their bags in months. A similar pattern of diamond hands can be found in the other top ten holders. You can see the last time more than 10,000,000 Hege tokens occurred was 21 days ago.  **Robust recovery.** In the previous sale, now worth over $246,000 USD, the resulting dip was quickly scooped up by new buyers. Simply put, it is unlikely that any single seller can cause an unrecoverable price crash.  **Sizable CEX wallet.** The community and developers have contributed generously. It currently stands at 30K USD and was as high as 140K USD. It's unlikely such a large wallet would be maintained if the developers intended to cut and run.  **Active and sensible socials.** Based on the age of the project, the number of likes on a typical Twitter post is about what you'd expect from a growing project. Not zero, but not some ridiculous bot-manipulated number either.  Reddit posts tend to hover between 10-100 likes per posting. This is about what you should expect from a community that pushes its most active Telegram members to participate in Reddit promotional postings.  Of course, a meme-coin lives and dies by the strength of its community. Hege is strong on this front, with a very active Telegram. Not only is the community active, but I have personally seen the developers post frequently and interact with the community. Regular voice meetings are held too. In these meetings, the developers appear articulate, hard-working, and intelligent. The recorded meetings are available on Hege's Twitter.  Last but not least, may I present what is perhaps the best verification of them all:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/vzh6cu4j1mbd1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f78c2dc28943110766e4cf6ae072a909414ed5c1  The lead developer's sister allegedly made this. Who creates culinary confections for a scam?  ## How much can I make?  Let's take a look at a $100, $1000 and $10000 USD investment if made today at roughly \~20M market cap. We'll look at near-term returns like 50 million, all the way up to returns should Hege go parabolic in a future bull run.  |20M|50M|100M|500M|1B|5B|10B| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |100|250|500|2500|5000|25,000|50,000| |1000|2500|5000|25,000|50,000|250,000|500,000| |10000|25000|50,000|250,000|500,000|2,500,000|5,000,000|  Could Hege reach a 1 billion market cap? 10 billion? I believe the answer is yes and possibly yes. Many meme coins like Dogwifhat and Pepe have soared past a 1B market cap and continue to grow. These projects have all achieved these valuations before any proper bull run. At its peak, Shib reached nearly 60 and Doge 90 billion! Hege may never reach 90 billion, but what you might not know is that Hege is growing much faster than Shiba did in its early months.  Take a look at the Kendu chart as measured from its creation to three months:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/myg6g13k1mbd1.jpg?width=1962&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d1d4745e8706ba5783b55374309497b2417d6bc  Now look at Hege's chart:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/t7n061qk1mbd1.png?width=1948&format=png&auto=webp&s=80945c66643cbe33fba733a4ab990487b193f4c7  Both projects have strong, active communities and similar charts. Kendu jumped up to 100M+ after three months. It was a well-deserved jump as they worked hard for it, just like Hege is doing now.  I believe that the best play is to take a large position and do it fast. Hege is perfectly positioned as a young project with huge growth potential, but not so young that its long-term viability is untested. Hege's growth is also clearly present and moving fast. You may want to get in before the traditionally strong fall season and hold through till the next bull run. Big bets on Hege are already coming in, with a record $37,000 USD two days ago. That individual has since bought more. Even if the markets don't follow past historical trends, a bull run always happens. It's not a matter of if, but when. Of course, all the usual warnings apply. I am not a financial expert. Do your own research.  My conviction is simple: Meme coins offer undeniable opportunity. Hege will be profitable. It could be very, very profitable. It could be the life-changing play you are looking for.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/q9x6ydil1mbd1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71b374363ebd231e5f613531d29fab902d4dc97d  Note: I can provide Solscan wallet links for addresses described above, but unfortunately SubReddits tend to ban external links or even wallet addresses so feel free to message me in Hege's Telegram if you need verification.","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/JupiterExchange - r/OreSupply - r/SolanaNFT  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

MemeCoins,Kendu Inu: A Turning Point,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1hg6r5v/kendu_inu_a_turning_point/,12/17/2024,82,"# Overview  A brief Kendu Inu background to start, Kendu is an organic community with a simple aim, build the world’s biggest memecoin, and do this by through the hard work of the community. This is summed up in the Kendu moto, “We don’t gamble, we work”  Over the last nine months, the Kendu community has built a solid foundation, with 16.1k on chain holders, great token distribution, numerous Kendu affiliated brands such as Kendu energy drinks or Kendu coffee. Above all, Kendu has built a strong engaged community, unlike anything else I have seen in crypto.  Kendu is on the Ethereum chain, and you’ll most likely be aware the market is roaring. It is widely predicted this is the start of a bull run, with the prediction that memecoins will flourish after BTC/ETH start to calm.  # Strong Metric Improvement  What is happening now which motivates this post is Kendu has hit a turning point. This marks the end of a 90% consolidation, where 79% of supply was redistributed, and the start of the next phase. You can clearly see this in the Kendu chart, which is up 2x from the bottom with Kendu at \~40M market cap. What caused this turning point is quite simple: hard work done by the community to build Kendu. This is exactly what will keep Kendu growing time and time again, and is Kendu’s path to being the biggest memecoin ever.  With this turn, Kendu is seeing good increases in important metrics: Holders is increasing much faster than before, volume has increased, community engagement on social media has likewise risen. What’s more, on average between them, the combination these metrics is continuing to increase continually.  The biggest factors of memecoin potential, for me, is holder count and engagement. The engagement increases Kendu is seeing are organic, and it’s more than just holders, there is many new holders have become active community members, and are helping to build the community. This has been encouraged by the community, a number of initiatives to foster growth including video competitions, poker competitions, and a number of real life meet ups.  # Kendu Accelerators  Kendu growth will come from the Kendu community, but there is also a number of interesting things lining up in Kendu which feel can combine to give Kendu an additional boost:  1. Kendu is bridging to SOL. This is a tunnel, functioning as an additional CEX. Kendu will stay the same, but with an additional SOL audience.  2. Kendu will soon get a free Certik Audit. Kendu became only the second community ever to qualify for this (the other recently hit a $10B MC)  3. The Kendu developer, Miazaki, doxed at the bottom. Lots of community members also did the same following the announcement, and I see this as a sign of conviction in Kendu.  4. Following his dox, Miazaki started being followed by Shib leader Shytoshi, and also the creator of Doge, Shibetoshi Nakamoto liked Kendu posts.  5. The connections Miazaki has to Shib have long been rumored, some even calling him Ryoshi. All I can say for sure is Miazaki became a moderator of the Shib sub-reddit recently, and combining that with Shytoshi links shows some some strong connections.  6. An interesting article was published a month ago in the Daily coin which claims connections between the funding sources of Kendu and Shib, possibly hinting at institutional Kendu backing: [https://dailycoin.com/is-shib-preparing-to-say-goodbye/](https://dailycoin.com/is-shib-preparing-to-say-goodbye/)  None of this additional connections and activity will change the fundamentals of Kendu. Kendu is not simply a memecoin but an idea to get behind; a global brand; a movement. The community behind Kendu is what will make Kendu succeed  I believe Kendu has what it takes to be the biggest memecoin of this cycle, possibly ever, and encourage everyone to join the telegram so you can see the Kendu energy  and potential for yourselves.","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/MemecoinsOnSui - r/MemecoinMoonshots - r/SolanaNFT  Also check out the official discord for r/Memecoins: https://discord.gg/YM9sSDbsBh   *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

MemeCoins,The Next Big Memecoin ,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1fpk4lw/the_next_big_memecoin/,9/26/2024,103,"Hi all!  I’m excited to share some news about $PEIRO on Ethereum. This project is generating a lot of buzz in the crypto community, and it seems to have great potential.  One of the things I really appreciate about $PEIRO is its commitment to giving back. They’ve already donated a total of $15K to charity, including $5K to Doge Pound and $10K to Bob Burnquist, the legendary OG skateboarder.  In terms of connections, the team behind $PEIRO has hosted influential figures like NEIRO's CTO, Kendu, and Baby Neiro on their official X account, along with other projects that have market caps in the millions or even hundreds of millions. This kind of networking is very bullish for such a new low-market coin.  Currently, $PEIRO has a market cap of around $390K and over 370 holders. Given that the project is less than three weeks old, it’s building a solid foundation just in time for the upcoming bull run.  Looking ahead, there are some exciting events planned. $PEIRO will soon host a Shib OG who has worked directly with Ryoshi. Additionally, the team has mentioned that an app is in the works to help increase $PEIRO’s exposure to other crypto communities.  If you’re interested in being part of this exciting journey, be sure to check out their Telegram and visit their website at [peirocoin.com](http://peirocoin.com) for more information.","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/OreSupply - r/SolanaNFT  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is now a $370m rocket. 69b tokens, all circulating. Zero taxes, no shares to the owner. Up 160% this month and up 8100% since launch, still surfing the memecoin wave. Miss it now, and you’ll pay more later.  Why $TURBO? - It’s community driven. There is no sole person running this, it’s the people. There is no rug pulls, there is no blacklist. This coin is solely run by YOU and ME. The people who buy and sell it.  - $TURBO has a story! It was the FIRST memecoin to ever be created by AI. Using ChatGPT 4, it was tasked to come up with the next “big” meme coin. After researching SHIBA and DOGE, it came up with a strategy to implement itself as the next 1000x. During this massive AI and Crypto boom we are currently going through, who doesn’t want a piece of history? First AI coin?  - It’s cheap! Get it now, seriously why not? It’s cheap and for a low price you can score a huge bag. Its peak was just the beginning. It’s already itching itself slowly to get back to that number. It’s just waiting for the next big jump. Even if you just invest a little bit, it can go a long way.  - It’s listed on over 100 exchanges and many more to come. The more people like you and I who invest, the more hype it gets, and the more hype it gets, the more exchanges want a piece of the profit.  $TURBO isn’t just a meme coin, it’s a top coin in the making for 2025.  Even just a dollar, or ten, or 100. Any difference YOU make can take you to the moon.

I saw it but didn’t buy it. One day I was in NYC and I saw a billboard. In that moment, I knew I had to research further. The first thing that really interested me was the community; it was stronger than anything I’ve seen. I always was the kind of person who waited for coins to be listed on top CEXs, but this time I knew I couldn’t wait.  Since then, I’ve seen Shytoshi join the TG, listings on 14 exchanges, articles from some of the biggest names in crypto, and recently, Coinbase featured Kendu in an ad that was amongst billion-dollar projects. You can’t tell me that happened by accident.  What excites me the most is Kendu Chads, which has been hinted at by the dev, Miazaki, multiple times. Every time he mentions it, it’s very mysterious in a way that shows he knows what he created is special. He speaks about it with conviction, and the entire community has the same sentiment.  A project can’t be successful if no one’s talking about it. I heard about SHIB and DOGE in real life. No one has ever come up to me talking about other projects. Those two were different because they had a group of people willing to get their parents, brothers, friends, coworkers, and even grandmothers in on it. Word of mouth spreads more than you can imagine. That’s what gets people talking: once you bring it to the real world.  The people involved in this project believe in it so much they’re willing to risk their friends’ and families’ money on it. They know it will turn into something like we’ve never seen before. I can’t say I’ve seen that anywhere besides SHIB and DOGE. There is going to come a time this cycle when everyone has heard the name Kendu.","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/JupiterExchange - r/OreSupply - r/SolanaNFT  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Kendu is 100% organic from the ground up. That means no paid shilling, advertisements, influencers, or listings. Every bit of growth in this project is because of the community.   We are a part of the SHIB ecosystem, supported by Shytoshi Kusama, the developer of SHIB.   Our holders have increased from 1500 (early may) to over 12,200 today. Thats an 8x in 2 months. ORGANICALLY.   We are currently listed on 14 exchanges. We paid for none of them.   We have yet to see a day of NEGATIVE holder growth.   We have our own Kendu energy drinks.

There are many projects that failed hard with those logos. Kendu is the hardest working community I've ever seen.   The way you make your memecoin succeed is by getting retail and KOLs to buy it. How do you get retail and KOLs to buy your project? You can pay them, which isn't scalable and result in a mediocre coin as once your funds are gone your project dies.   Or you could make a community of dedicated holders who advertise the coin for free so they make more money from it. That is infinitely scalable. Kendu has the catchphrase: We don't gamble, we work. Which means everyone tries his best to advertise for this coin, which will result in a very strong ecosystem if done correctly.   This also means when the market doesn't go our way there will be big consolidations as there are no catalysts to pump the coin. Right now we've finished one of those consolidations.   The fact is that dedicated holders were able to buy cheap kendu tokens from soft hands. This way there is almost no sell pressure left during the next leg up as the believers in kendu won't sell. This way the pump will be way bigger.   By being organic the listings and catalysts will come automatically, which means when the ball starts rolling, the price and volume goes up and the big listings will start to come through, which will get the price to explode even more and get the volume even higher. This way we get into a momentum driven virtuous cycle. The opposite of a vicious cycle. This is our plan to conquer defi, and by getting trending 5 times on X the last 2 months as a coin that's barely in the top 500 biggest marketcaps I'm certain there's a big potential here. We are also working on an NFT marketplace, which has been the biggest mint of the last 2 year. We have Kendu energy and kendu coffee as IRL brands. We have 12 tattoos in our community showcasing our dedication.   Our advertising is arguably the best of every memecoin there is, so if we can keep this up and even increase our output, one day we will be at the top. Ofcourse this takes time.   I'm certain Miazaki has a lot of bullish catalysts left for us, but he's waiting patiently until the time is right and all the pumpchasers are out.","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/OreSupply - r/SolanaNFT  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We are about to blow!,"You touch on a lot of great points here, which dig down to the heart of Kendu:  To be successful as a memecoin, you need something to drive this. Past an initial pump or two, this something is hard to find, but Kendu isn’t relying on external factors, because the community themselves are the factor. What’s more, though an extremely active telegram, Reddit community and X spaces, and overwhelming quantity of the community understands this and happily contributes. My story is similar to many I’ve heard: I never worked for a bag before Kendu, but am happy to help spread the Kendu word.  This approach isn’t new, it’s what made Shib massive, but the way Kendu are doing it is by far stronger than any other community project I’ve watched.  The Kendu community is only getting stronger over time, and this Kendu work ethic is what will take Kendu to $100B. Anyone who is intrigued I’d advise to join the telegram and ask questions,  I am confident you will be impressed","Couldn’t agree more!

I’ve personally **spent almost $200k** into marketing, burns, buybacks, memes, video content, market makers, meme contests, and much more. We were able to hit a $7M market cap after starting at around $500k when I first shared [NeiRei on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1f9520p/missed_my_200x_on_ikigai_heres_another_chance/). Now, following a **two-month-long accumulation** phase, NeiRei is ready for its next run.  The extended accumulation phase was designed to get rid of weak hands and replace them with diamond-handed holders who are committed to pushing this project to the next level.  This week, I’ve secured **BTOK’s #1 trending ads** for NeiRei. They start running today! For those unfamiliar, **BTOK is essentially the Chinese version of Telegram**, and since most of the crypto community—especially in the memecoin space—uses Telegram, targeting the Chinese audience makes perfect sense. After all, **NeiRei is the Chinese Neiro**! BTOK ads aren't cheap either... They cost $3k/day so come in and help out the community as much as possible! Extra points if you speak Mandarin :).  Additionally, we’ll be doing Dexscreener boost, using Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) for calls, activating professional raiders, and deploying market makers for volume.  If you’re a diamond hander looking to join a relentless community with the [BEST memes](https://x.com/NeiReiTokenETH/status/1864128673521258821) in the space, NeiRei is the project for you.  # Summary for the Newcomers  Just like $Peipei is the Chinese version of $Pepe, **$NeiRei is the Chinese version of $Neiro**. Peipei reached 4% of Pepe's market cap, so it’s only reasonable to assume that NeiRei could also reach **4% of Neiro’s market cap**, which would put it at **over $40M**—a 14x from here.  As most of you know (unless you've been living under a rock), **Neiro is the new Doge** of this bull run and has already surpassed $1b market cap. It’s **THE hottest coin** in crypto right now, and NeiRei will be right there along for the ride.  **NeiRei is THE ""Neirei-tive"" this cycle!** ;)  # Socials and Details  **CA**: 0x1d4fb9bfa1967be6ca74819e28b98c2aa5ae8b59  * Dextools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/en/token/neirei?t=1725477402604](https://www.dextools.io/app/en/token/neirei?t=1725477402604) * Website: neireitoken .xyz * Taxes: 0/0 * Contract Renounced * Liquidity Burnt * 100% Community Takeover * Telegram: @ neireiofficial * X: @ neireitokeneth * Not Financial Advice","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/MemecoinsOnSui - r/MemecoinMoonshots - r/SolanaNFT  Also check out the official discord for r/Memecoins: https://discord.gg/YM9sSDbsBh   *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It’s powered by AI too, which adds an interesting layer.  The community seems really active. Their Telegram’s always buzzing, people are constantly dropping memes, and there’s this fun, chaotic energy that feels good. You can tell folks actually enjoy being part of it. What also stands out is that A47 isn’t just floating on hype. It’s linked to a bigger project, Agenda 47 which gives it some backing and structure. It’s not trying to copy what’s already out there; it’s doing its own thing.  They’ve been hinting at more content soon meme news videos, maybe some interactive stuff for holders. And that recent post on the Champions League? That one actually got me hyped, but it was clever and well-timed.  It still feels early. But, It did a 2x pump after the gate listing. And I think a major announcement is coming that could pump it more. So, if you missed the early days of PEPE or DOGE, this kind of feels like that before it pops stage.

MemeCoins,You Don't Believe Us - Here is what ChatGPT is Sayin' - $100B Marketcap!,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1fydt8t/you_dont_believe_us_here_is_what_chatgpt_is_sayin/,10/7/2024,81,"**Prompt:** Tell me why $Kendu will reach $100B MC this cycle  **Answer:** For Kendu to reach a $100 billion market cap, several key factors would need to align. Here’s why this is plausible:  **1. Memecoin Adoption Leading the Bull Cycle**  Memecoins like Doge and Shib have historically led the charge during bull markets, capturing mainstream attention. In the previous cycle, Shib reached a market cap of over $40 billion. Given that we’re entering a new bull cycle, memecoins like Kendu are positioned to take advantage of heightened investor interest. This cycle is projected to be even more intense, and Kendu could ride this momentum as people pour into high-risk, high-reward assets.  **2. Solid Community and Organic Growth**  Kendu is focusing on organic growth and community involvement, which is essential for the sustainability of any memecoin project. The dedication and investment from early adopters, combined with innovative marketing strategies (like using influencers or targeting different investment demographics), can drive continuous growth.  **3. Distribution and Solid Floor**  The token distribution among top wallets creates a stable floor price for Kendu. This foundation helps prevent massive dumps, which is a common issue in other memecoins. If the early investors believe in the long-term potential, they are less likely to sell prematurely, allowing the project to grow and gain a more mainstream audience.  **4. Bull Market Timing**  Historically, Bitcoin runs strongly between late 2024 and early 2025, and as B TC rises, it pulls the rest of the market along with it. Memecoins thrive in these speculative environments, often outperforming traditional crypto assets. If this trend holds true, Kendu will benefit from this macro crypto cycle.  **5. Revenue Generation from NFTs**  Kendu’s NFT marketplace adds another layer of revenue generation. By integrating revenue-sharing mechanisms and offering exclusive NFTs to the community, Kendu taps into both crypto and NFT enthusiasts. If this marketplace becomes popular, it could significantly boost the overall market cap of Kendu.  **6. Miazaki’s Track Record**  The developer of Kendu, Miazaki, is a retired multi-millionaire who worked on Shiba Inu. His experience, combined with the lessons learned from previous cycles, gives Kendu a strategic advantage. If Miazaki and his team can replicate even a fraction of Shiba Inu’s success, Kendu could easily achieve a market cap in the tens of billions, if not $100 billion.  **7. Growing Use of NFTs and Crypto for Mainstream Adoption**  Just as NFTs were pivotal in driving adoption in the last cycle, memecoins could lead in this one. With more people entering the crypto space and looking for the next big thing, a memecoin with a solid ecosystem, community, and strong marketing like Kendu could capture a significant portion of new capital.  By leveraging these elements, Kendu has a real chance to hit $100 billion, especially in an environment where speculative assets thrive during bull markets. The narrative, community-driven growth, and innovative tech make this a plausible goal.  **Spread the word! Share your stories!

There are also several members within the TG group of Hege that has a responsibility of being early to big influencers with large followings to post Hege related memes and share them with the rest of the group. They make sure that everyone is on-board to shill the coin and make sure that every eye in the space knows about us.  **Our listing**s  We are currently listed on five exchanges, with one more coming 23^(rd) July.  * Toobit * Azbit * SuperEX * Indoex * Bitmart * MEXC (23^(rd) July)  This list is in chronological order, and as you can see, we are only getting on bigger and bigger exchanges. There is still a ton of potential growth within this category, and what I can say is that it’s being worked on.   With the listing on MEXC, our biggest to date. The team has set aside 20.000$ for marketing. Considering the market of MEXC we can potentially see a new ATH on this project alone. 20.000$ is a lot of money to spend on getting new holders, and if you read the team that is responsible for handling the marketing you will know that the outcome will certainly be great.     **Our Marketing Move**s  * Billboard video of $HEGE in NY  * Fundings to get listed on exchanges (120.000$ was funded for a listing on MEXC in just four days) * FWH program – Friend with Hege was a donation program to fund our marketing wallet. The ones who donated got whitelisted to our upcoming NFT program, as well as having their own unique roles in the telegram group. * Tiktok contest, meme contest, reddit contest, raid contest – we make sure to have everyone competing to win $Hege as they shill the coin on their preferred platform. * Upcoming plane ad of $Hege over Hollywood for THREE HOURS * Started focusing on TikTok, Instagram and Youtube recently in an attempt to reach out to normies which has been a key factor in becoming a household name for other coins such as Ponke, Doge, and Bonk.  **Our Communit**y  This is the first time I’ve been actively in a meme coin community, and so far, it’s been nothing, but great. The community in $Hege is very welcoming, a part from uniting to shill, we talk about every day life, we share ideas on stunts we can do to increase holders, the team is there in the chat with us to give us updates and announcements as well as listen to our opinions and ideas. We share memes and artwork of $Hege, we speculate on both $Hege and the crypto market in general.  You don’t have to have single $Hege to join the group and see for yourself that this community is amazing. I suggest starting here if you are planning on doing more research after reading this post.  # Social Stats  * Telegram: 6,054 members * X: 12,000 followers * Tiktok: 718 followers * YouTube: 105 subscribers * Instagram: 242 followers * Hege's website  # Financial Stats  * Holders: 7,352 * Market Cap: $13.4 million * **ATH**: $30 million  https://preview.redd.it/3rexo4c2kndd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f5814a98ec82a377a82f7fc2fb2d5cba522b5d0","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/JupiterExchange - r/OreSupply - r/SolanaNFT  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

MemeCoins,"""Somebody is going to make a billion dollars around here""",https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1e449h8/somebody_is_going_to_make_a_billion_dollars/,7/15/2024,75,"The crypto market as a whole is growing by the day in its total market cap, total holders, and institutional investments. The crypto market runs in well-known bull cycles, and the new ETFs in bitcoin and now Ethereum are only adding gas to this fire. All of this is taking place while the traditional global economy experiences growing FUD by the day.  The net result is that there are enormous gains to be made in the emerging crypto markets while the standard investments and strategies yield diminishing returns.   **100X vs 10%**  Standard stock market index funds average around 10% gains per year over long periods of time. Given a long enough time period and consistent investments, this strategy can build wealth, and many people have benefited from it. But it is uncertain and the average investor is growing ever more weary and distrustful of it.  Meanwhile in the crypto world there are coins being minted every day, and some of them skyrocket to 100X or even 1000X gains within a year or two. These coins become household names and the small time investors who are struggling with their 401Ks to make 10% watch their co-workers retire early because of mysterious memecoins and alt-coins.  **Strategies**  There are a few wise strategies for making retirement-grade money from this new market.   Diversification: One strategy is to throw $1000 (or some amount) at ten different coins hoping that one of them is a spaceship, while assuming the others will be losses. This is a basic diversification strategy and it works to some degree. But it only works if one or two out of ten are big winners, and even then it is rare for a $1000 investment to turn into retirement money. A 100X is a fantastic gain, but it is not enough to retire unless you started with $10,000 or more.  All-In - The other strategy is to put it all into one and hope for the best. By this strategy an investor may have $10,000, and on a good recommendation, a strong hunch, some due diligence, and a wish upon a star, they throw it all into one coin and hope for a 100X. 100X times $10,000 is a million, and they are set for life, more or less. But all of this hinges on them making the right pick, and far too often it fails.  **The New Way Forward**  From where we sit right now the obvious front-runner for a new coin with potential to go 100X or even 1000X is Kendu Inu. Yes there are other coins, but no, none of them have the team, the proven track record, and future plans, and the conviction to compete with Kendu. It is possible that others will succeed, but the clear and obvious front-runner is Kendu Inu, and second place is a long way behind, and not gaining.  **No Gambling**   What makes Kendu Inu different is that it does not follow the gambling strategies of the other coins. Instead of asking you to wish upon a star and throw your hard-earned money into it, Kendu says throw your money and your time and your creativity into it, join a huge team, and force it to be successful.  This strategy takes Kendu out of the ""investment"" category and puts it into a new category of work and investment, compounded by a team of 12,000 other people (and growing every day). The creativity and sheer volume of this army makes its success virtually guaranteed in the middle of a wasteland of scams and false hopes. This potential, combined with the supportive team, has brought Kendu on a new run. People are jumping in every few minutes, desperate to get a piece of this rocket.  **The Full Potential**  A few years ago Doge broke over 90Billion in market cap, and Shib broke over 40Billion the same year. Since then the amount of money flowing into crypto markets has more than tripled and the number of holders has more than quadrupled. Far more people with far more dollars are invested in this space now than ever before. If Doge could break 90billion, it is safe to say the next truly big coin will break over 100Billion. The community and developers at Kendu believe their coin will go to ""100Billion and beyond."" This stated goal means that 100Billion is the floor of Kendu's potential, not the ceiling. Anything lower than 100B is a buying opportunity, not the destination.   This is why people are buying in constantly. Holder growth has gone up literally every single day of Kendu's existence, and as more money pours in and more holders pour in, there is no real ceiling to how high this can go.  [If the floor is 100Billion, the ceiling is only limited by how hard the team works.](https://preview.redd.it/07zuqfk5lqcd1.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=33f0f65992a1a0c57a58a42a951b20b2895c0582)  Regardless of Kendu's goals, it is obvious that there is life-changing potential in crypto markets and memes in particular. Small time investors who are willing to not only put their money into it, but also their time, energy, and creativity, have an opportunity to control their own destiny like never before and find freedom from the 10% index fund.","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/JupiterExchange - r/OreSupply - r/SolanaNFT  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

MemeCoins,A personal and honest story about $Hege for new investors worth reading.,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ea4ijp,7/23/2024,47,"About 4 months ago, I started investigating memecoins. I have been in crypto since 2017 and invested in projects like Doge, Shiba, Litecoin, Digibyte, and some others. At that time, I was very young and did not have much money to spend. My Ethereum, which I bought for under $100 if I remember correctly, did a 3x and I cashed out. I believe I owned 0.3 ETH. The same story applies to all the other coins I held. I never made much money because I couldn't invest a lot. The main reason I didn't make money at that time was due to a lack of patience and not having a plan. As I said, I was young and making $100 on a $25 investment was insane. I calculated that my holdings would resemble $350,000 if I had held them, and that calculation is from more than a year ago!  Four months ago, I came across some marketing for a presale of a Solana memecoin. I decided to buy the presale, thinking the coin would launch in a week or so. I ended up waiting for more than a month. Meanwhile, my Solana investment had already dropped in value. During that month of waiting, I began to understand the Solana blockchain and its features. I downloaded some Solana wallets and read a lot on Reddit. While on Reddit, I came across $Hege. Seeing a yellow hedgehog-like figure made me think this could be original. I did not have a clue how to buy this meme coin, which looked fun. I invested $500 in the other presale I mentioned, so I didn't look further into $Hege. But I came across the hedgehog-like figure more often. The longer the presale of that other coin took, the more I got interested in $Hege. I learned that I could buy coins through Jupiter Swap. I had to search it up through the online browser of my Solana wallet. I had no clue….  Being enthusiastic about finding a way to buy $Hege, I bought $30 worth of $Hege. This felt great but a bit scary. I downloaded Dexscreener on my phone and learned more about $Hege and its story-driven approach, unlocking things like NFTs at certain milestones. I bought a couple of hundred dollars worth of $Hege more, between the range of 4.5 million in market cap and 7 million market cap. Soon after, $Hege started a downtrend….  I've learned from my mistakes in the past. I'm older now and I can use more money for investments. With these facts in my head, I decided to chill and engage with the community of Hege through Telegram. I started to understand that $Hege is a business with people working full-time for it. I was familiar with rugpulls and other scams and even fell for them myself….. I was determined to find the project that is going to buy me a house!   During a long time of consolidation and building a community, I did something that’s going to change my life!  I invested $1,750 in $Hege when it dropped to 2.8 million in market cap. It gave me such a rush and I started to feel connected with the hedgehog-like figure and its community. I'm the type of guy that loves to look at his investments and do analyses all day. Because $Hege has a family-like community, I could talk with them all day! They even let me run competitions I made up and gave me all the trust in the world. Once, I held over $7,000 in donations to give out to the participants of a huge competition. That speaks of trust, doesn't it?  I held on to my bag and even bought a little bit more once in a while. Hege exploded after a month of consolidation. My $3,000 investment was now worth $30,000! I always held on to my bag and traded with a maximum of 20% of my total $Hege holding to increase my positions. At the time of writing, I managed to increase my bag to 1.5 million $Hege.   By making mistakes in the past by selling too early and getting emotional, I am now very patient and have set myself a goal. I want to buy a house since I'm young and where I live, it's hard to get a house without saved-up money. I calculated that I can buy a house with an investment of $100,000. I’ll reach this when $Hege gets to 68 million in market cap. I'm planning to sell little chunks of $Hege to fulfill my dream. The $Hege team supports my dream and is willing to help people who want to take profits but don't want to hurt the project!  My initial investment of around $3,000 could possibly buy me the house I’m saving up for before the end of 2024.   As said before, I like analyzing memecoins and their charts and I like to stay connected to the community to sometimes influence decisions. What I discovered is that $Hege is in a similar phase as it was before climbing to an ATH of 30 million market cap starting from 2.8 million. If $Hege’s history repeats itself and does a 10x next run-up, we will close far above 100 million in market cap. I’m a bit of a conservative guy and like to be realistic. Stars are aligned for $Hege since it’s creating an extremely bullish pattern and it’s getting listed on a top 10 exchange today! MEXC listed $Hege and attached a $20,000 airdrop to it! My honest prediction is $Hege rising to a market cap of above 70 million once breaking out of consolidation.  Compared to the last similar phase, we are 75% of the way to breaking out. Some people think $Hege is breaking out this week. I personally think $Hege is going to rise in the coming weeks when Solana makes a little nosedive. I discovered that people tend to invest their Solana in memecoins when Solana is dropping in price.  Remember, the bull run is yet to come!  Do you have the conviction and courage to drop $3,000 in $Hege? This could be worth over $30,000 in a matter of weeks. I believe history will repeat itself for $Hege.  $Hege has proven itself to be trustworthy and the team is working full-time to run this business, no day jobs involved anymore!  If you like to be involved in a family-like community and like to grow your bag with some fun guys, I advise you to join the $Hege Telegram group. If you like to invest and hold to see what you can achieve without spending time in a community, that’s fine too! I would love to see some of you new investors in the Telegram group.  DM me (Nick) and tell me you invested through this post and I’ll help you guys where I can!   Once my goal is achieved, I will update the people that like to see my dream fulfilled.

Basically saying that it's a bunch of people circlejerking each other and that's supposed to be good?

MemeCoins,Thoughts on KENDU Chads launch,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1ehr5j2/thoughts_on_kendu_chads_launch/,8/1/2024,63,"Hello y'all,  I'd like to share my own thought process on the launch of Chads, as its debut seems to have caused some concern.  First a bit of backstory of my own experience with NFTs last cycle. I have been in crypto since 2013 and held mostly BTC and some ETH. Last cycle I saw a couple friends hit big on DOGE and then SHIB, but mostly stayed away because I was a utility / decentralization guy. Obviously, my BTC and ETH holds have performed well over the long run, and I will continue to hold the BTC into the foreseeable future. However, I realized last cycle that there was serious money to be made in memes and hype coins if you could pick right. I dabbled in SHIB toward the end, was in and out with a small amount of money that I did okay on, but nothing huge. My big lesson was with LRC, which I got into before it took off with the GME hype, around the NFT marketplace. I basically roundtripped all the money I put in, which was a significant amount for me at the time, and was basically caught off guard by the subsequent downfall and discontinuation of the marketplace. I ended up getting a little more then my initial investment out and a sour taste in my mouth for NFT's.  Flash forward to May of this year and I was looking thru reddit and came across a [](https://www.reddit.com/user/boathouse_floats/) post about KENDU, and was instantly sold. I joined telegram, took a look at dexscreener and got in right about the 10m MC mark. Literally sold all my other shitcoins and full ported all my ETH into KENDU once I experienced the telegram community. I have continued to hold regardless of the ups and downs since then, only taking my initial plus a couple hundred dollars out when we pumped past 200M mc. (I know, I know JEEET you say, but I've been around long enough to know if you're up over 10x you better take out your initial, so sue me.)  Anyhow, to the launch of Chads. Obviously, we had no indication till yesterday that it would be an NFT marketplace. My first reaction when I heard it was NOOOO not this again, followed by doubt. However after sleeping on it last night I realized a couple things.  1. I still believe in the use case of NFT's as a whole. I believe they can have real world applications in many different sectors, the most important of which, I believe, is allowing artists to control access to and profit from their work without having to get hired by a company which pays them shit and takes all of the real profit from their work. 2. Buying a Chad is not just buying a shitty JPEG turned NFT. It is buying a share of a platform, that with the KENDU communities backing, has the possibility to become a contender in the global NFT marketplace. 3. Most importantly, Chads as a platform, is doing something no other NFT platform is doing as far as I know (correct me in the comments if I'm wrong). That is, it is allowing the community behind it to buy shares (by buying Chads NFT's) that will produce dividends for holding, based on the sales that run through the platform once it launches to the public. 4. Upon rereading the SHIB article and listening to the space again I also realized that Miazaki has made a pretty smart move by requiring that minting collections on the platform be paid in KENDU, but when those collections are sold to the public by creators, the sales are in ETH. This means that there is basically buy only pressure on KENDU, which will obviously benefit holders.  I've seen a lot of comments by people who either haven't been around long, or haven't been paying attention, crying about Miazaki saying in spaces that he's gonna blow the Chad's proceeds on strippers and cocaine. All I have to say to that is if you believe he's serious about that, I have a bridge to sell you. I know it turns some people away, but that's his whole schtick. He talks shit and then turns around and gives 100% to the community / project. Also, he has said in spaces that he is going to use the proceeds to benefit the project / get T1 listings, so please stop acting like he's gonna tank the project on purpose for his own benefit. I think there would have been way easier ways to do so if he wanted to rugpull.  Bottom line is, if you like NFT's, believe they could have a legitimate use case, and have the spare KENDU, buy a Chad. If you don't, hold your KENDU and chill because that's the sure way to make money. If you think people hating NFT's will tank this project, I respectfully disagree. There are plenty of people who still love NFT's (see daily trading volume of OpenSea) and getting even a small slice of that market is a net positive for KENDU holders. If a business adds a product that you don't like, but it makes the company money, why would you complain that your stock holdings appreciated in price because of it? Obviously the price action over the last two days has been down, but since the fundamental nature of the community has not changed, and we have now added a product that some people are sure to love (even if you personally don't), I cannot see how this is anything but a net positive in the long run.  For my part, after thinking it over and doing the math on returns from a chad, I realize it is a toss up on making my money back. However I believe in this project and I want to support the community in all its endeavors.  To that end I have minted 4 chads and will now commence holding them forever lol.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/memecoins) if you have any questions or concerns.*","Sharing what I said in the Kendu subreddit:  I bought some Chads. I’ve never had any interest in JPEG NFTs but I’ve owned stocks for a long time and a Chad is more like a stock certificate with a picture attached than what most people think of when NFTs are mentioned.  My Chads will pay me passive income based on volume. My Kendu is separate and will benefit from people buying Chads as the Kendu raised will be used to help Kendu get bigger and bolster the price of the token.  Miazaki said that the Kendu raised will not be sold and will help with things such as a Binance listing eventually.  I’m surprised by the reaction of some people and I can only assume they haven’t taken the time to understand what is happening.  The people who are likely to buy the most Chads are the people with the biggest amount of Kendu, in total 5% of the Kendu supply is being collected by Chads.  The bags of whales are getting smaller with zero sell pressure and the amount of Kendu that can be bought is decreasing. This is good for all Kendu holders.  Buying a Chad or not is a personal decision. Don’t spend the majority of your Kendu total on them. Kendu itself will always be at the centre of everything and this is a side project that benefits it even further.  We have got this far based on hard work and understanding where we are going. If Chads is not for you then that’s completely fine. The mission for Kendu hasn’t changed.","This was a genuine masterclass by miazaki and the masses will understand soon. Glad you and I are on the same page… on just about everything actually. We will see how quick adoption of this new interface is very soon. Once again, the Kendu dev overdelivered.","Couldn't agree more. Gotta say, really happy with how launch is being handled right now with Chads having first (and fair) access before the masses start to catch on. They have nooooo idea what's coming.",I am generally not as rosey as the majority of the Kendu cult despite still having a bag but I won’t bore you with why - just wanted to say I appreciated the thoughtful post that isn’t full of larp and kudos to you for taking profit as that’s the name of the game,0.0,0.9982,0.7184,0.9761,0.4588,0.4372,0.9398,4.5285,285.2955
MemeCoins,i bought for $3100. Did I make a mistake?,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1i31i8x/i_bought_for_3100_did_i_make_a_mistake/,1/16/2025,0,"It is highly likely that Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) will be listed on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, given its record-breaking presale and immense popularity. Here are the reasons why such a listing could happen:  1. Success of the Presale 	•	WEPE’s presale, raising over $45 million, is a remarkable achievement, especially for a meme coin. Major exchanges like Binance closely monitor new projects entering the market and favor those with strong community support and significant trading potential. 	•	This successful presale provides WEPE with a strong foundation for marketing and negotiations with exchanges.  2. Community and Popularity 	•	The listing of meme coins on major exchanges often depends on the size and activity of their communities. WEPE’s popularity across social media platforms like Telegram and Twitter creates significant pressure for exchanges to list the token. 	•	For example, Pepe (PEPE) was listed on Binance partly due to the viral attention surrounding it.  3. Meme Coin Trends on Major Exchanges 	•	Exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have listed meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) to capitalize on their high trading volumes and strong community demand. 	•	Meme coins often generate substantial trading volumes in the short term, making them financially attractive for major exchanges.  4. Competition Among Exchanges 	•	Crypto exchanges compete to list new, trending tokens to attract traders and increase their trading volume. WEPE’s massive presale and viral popularity make it a strong candidate for both centralized (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX).  5. Risk Factors 	•	While popularity is important, major exchanges also consider the transparency of the project, the reliability of the team, and regulatory concerns. If WEPE’s team demonstrates the token’s legitimacy and long-term growth potential, the chances of a listing increase significantly.  Conclusion  If WEPE’s popularity continues to grow and the project maintains an active and engaged community, it is highly likely to be listed on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. However, these exchanges also factor in regulatory issues and project transparency when making listing decisions. In the short term, WEPE may first appear on decentralized exchanges (e.g., Uniswap), and with sustained success, it could move to larger centralized platforms.","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/MemecoinsOnSui - r/MemecoinMoonshots - r/SolanaNFT  Also check out the official discord for r/Memecoins: https://discord.gg/YM9sSDbsBh  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You’re only as good as the people around you. Most of us who are in DeFi are used to Solana, which is full of locked chats, constant questions about when we’re going to pump, and frequent rug pulls. We’re conditioned to panic when the market cap drops and to panic sell. The developer typically leaves, and you rally for a day for your CTO before running to the next project, as does that developer.  I see a lot of newcomers in the Telegram group with this attitude. They quickly get snuffed out as KENDU has no tolerance for BS. You must have tough skin to understand the KENDU way and drop your preconceived notions from Solana gambling. You’re only as good as the people around you. If you want to surround yourself with a group of people who don’t complain and don’t get shaken out at the first sign of trouble, the KENDU army has a place for you. The KENDU army works during both green and red days, rain or shine.  I notice a lot of coins that have made it to a $1 billion market cap do not have a community behind them working to get their coin noticed. They rely on influencer YouTube videos or tweets. But how likely is it that a normal everyday person watches YouTube videos or searches tweets about meme coins? They’re preaching to the crowd that’s already in crypto. The reason SHIB was successful was because they had an army behind it, relentlessly bringing it to as many people as they could. KENDU is the greatest marketing team you can ask for. You can’t buy it. Once the army keeps growing and growing, they will have this attitude, and it will spread.  How many people are in your inner circle? Each person has a minimum of 30 people in their life, including family, co-workers, and friends. What if the KENDU army could get just one person to buy KENDU? That would double the number of holders. Now, let’s say they get one person to buy, and that same process repeats over and over again. Word of mouth is far more powerful than an influencer video that gets 20,000 views. This is why the power of community will be what gets KENDU to billions. I urge you to join the Telegram group [here](https://t.me/KenduInu).  I also suggest listening to the latest dev space, which encapsulates the KENDU attitude. You can find it [here](https://x.com/kenduinu/status/1812835499880649002?s=46).  Building an Ecosystem:  Miazaki is building a brand, and the community is the marketing team. This coin will have utility. Crypto, as a whole, has always been about providing something. Then, out of nowhere, meme coins entered the space and flipped the idea of having to provide utility on its head. Millionaires have been made by simply putting $100 into a dog joke. DOGE showed us you can get a meme to multiple billions but needed a better marketing strategy. SHIB showed us how to market a coin but needed something to maintain its value.  You gain awareness with the community taking this coin to the real world first and showing they are serious. We’ve seen this with people creating merch, energy drinks, songs, jewelry, and sponsoring nightclubs. You can check out the merch store [here](https://kenduinumerch.com/).  Now that you have everyone’s attention, you create value for the coin. The developer is 99% complete with a DApp called KENDU Chads that is said to completely change the game and is something that’s never been done before. From hints, you’ll be able to earn ETH without staking. Multiple big names in crypto will support this.  KENDU is joining the SHIB ecosystem, as revealed in this space with Xander’s from SHIB. You can listen to that [here](https://x.com/shibaxanders/status/1807579836635865483?s=46). There’s also one more thing called KENDU Cash, about which we currently have no information.  The developer and the community alike are working on ways to create a brand and a crypto that has purpose. I believe this will be the cryptocurrency with the most impact in the coming year.","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/JupiterExchange - r/OreSupply - r/SolanaNFT  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You touched on all the points I like the most about $KENDU, which are the ones listed below.     (These are just the top 3 but there are way more actually)     * **SHYTOSHI KUSAMA INVOLVED**  **Shiba Inu lead Dev Shytoshi Kusama**, considered among the **top 50** most influential people in the whole crypto space, is confirmed to be following Kendu Inu and holding a bag since at least $1M market cap.  **Kendu Miazaki**, Kendu Inu Dev, is one of his friends, and he made sure to bring Shy in at the right time.  Even though all details have yet to be revealed, it is known that **$KENDU** will play a role in the Shib ecosystem, which might explain Shytoshi’s involvement in Kendu Inu.  Make no mistake, though, Miazaki has always said that Kendu **has its own identity** and will not just be one of the small dogs existing under the SHIB umbrella.  One of the first Kendu utilities, named **Kendu Chads**, will be released in the following days after being thoroughly tested for months by Miazaki’s team of developers.     **- COMMUNITY**  What can I even say about the **Kendu Army**? Everybody knows about it.  With an unmatched work ethic and always ready to spread the word, the Kendu Army is what makes Kendu…**KENDU**!  People who join Kendu go from being dirty, tiny-handed jeets to muscular chads with strong and big hands.  You’re soon taught that success depends on you and to ask yourself, “**What can I do for $KENDU?**” instead of waiting for the team to release the “**next big thing**” and hoping for a pump while doing absolutely nothing to help.  We’ve got relentless **shillers** on any social media known to humanity, people making Kendu energy **drinks**, people managing a Kendu **merch store**, people with Kendu **tattoos**, people smashing plates on their heads in the name of Kendu, and much more.     **- ORGANIC GROWTH**  Kendu Inu fully believes in organic growth.  Apart from financing for the first **CEX** listing, so that “**normies**” were able to join the project without having to go through **DeFi** if not tech-savvy enough to avoid being scammed, Kendu Inu does not pay for any listing, call on   **Tg, post on X, video on YT or any other thing you can think of**.  All the influencers that talk about Kendu or CEXs that listed us have had to buy supply from the liquidity pool like any other person.  Kendu Miazaki explained this from the very beginning.  “**It might be slower, but it works**.” is what he used to say.  **Organic growth allows you to build a strong floor of diamond-handed holders** who fully believe in the project and do not believe in random FUD.  On the other hand, if you build your floor with people sent by influencers, everybody is ready to jeet at the first chance because they’re just there for a quick buck and do not see the bigger picture.  https://preview.redd.it/9eiuv3qrbwcd1.jpeg?width=780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb34211d5afbcb93cba329175bc0f015d39321a5","Kendu is a rare opportunity in that everything has been laid out on a platter for the taking, but the platter itself requires a bit of research to find.   You will only truly understand the potential Kendu has if you get involved with the community component. One of the best ways is to attend and listen to the X spaces and dev talks. Many are recorded and can be listened back to on YouTube as well: https://youtube.com/@kenduinuarmy?si=Qv7loFZ_QVK7Aw0w  All memecoins talk a big game. You need to be savvy in order to sniff out the real winners. You likely won’t be able to do this form Reddit posts alone, so do not forget the “do your own research” component of this space. Listen to the dev talks and you’ll get little hints at the alpha surrounding Kendu. Your future self will thank you for taking the time to do this today.","Well said!     Do not show up to the KENDU TG with wen questions and a negative vibe or looking to shill some poo coin you are in. We will remove you.

MemeCoins,TRUMP vs ELON - official coins and their impact,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1i4u13a/trump_vs_elon_official_coins_and_their_impact/,1/19/2025,8,"TRUMP vs. ELON Coins: Will They Moon or Bust?  The crypto world is buzzing with the launch of not one, but two high-profile memecoins—$TRUMP and $ELON. While $TRUMP has gained traction due to its direct endorsement by Donald Trump himself, the launch of an ""official"" $ELON coin adds another twist to the narrative. Let's dive into the possible trajectories for these tokens and what this means for $DOGE.  # $TRUMP Predictions  * **Momentum:** $TRUMP is riding on Trump's political clout and massive following. The initial hype and astronomical trading volume (\~$1.5B in 6 hours) suggest it could continue surging short-term as traders FOMO in. * **Sustainability:** The tokenomics (80% locked supply) will likely keep prices volatile. Once the lock-up ends, watch out for possible sell-offs by insiders. * **Outlook:** Likely to moon for a while, but the long-term depends on whether Trump uses it as a serious part of his campaign or if it fades like other hype-driven tokens.    # $ELON Predictions  * **Concerns About Authenticity:** Unlike $TRUMP, the $ELON coin has no confirmed endorsement by Elon Musk (yet). This raises doubts about its legitimacy. Could it be a **rug pull**? Definitely worth treading carefully. * **Potential Impact:** If Musk endorses it (even jokingly), expect a DOGE-style rally. Otherwise, it might remain speculative and fail to gain traction. * **Outlook:** Until Elon Musk directly acknowledges the token, $ELON might struggle to establish itself beyond being another speculative memecoin.    # What Happens to $DOGE?  Elon and Trump have historically supported $DOGE as the ""people's coin."" However, the introduction of these official coins might shift attention:  1. **Short-Term Impact:** Liquidity could flow away from $DOGE to $TRUMP and $ELON as traders chase quick gains. 2. **Long-Term Impact:** If neither $TRUMP nor $ELON delivers on utility, traders might rotate back to $DOGE, which already has a strong community and broader adoption.    # Key Risks and Final Thoughts  1. **Hype-Driven Volatility:** Both coins are extremely risky, especially with limited market history. 2. **Potential Rug Pulls:** Be cautious with $ELON, as its legitimacy isn’t verified. 3. **Market Impact:** These coins could temporarily drain liquidity from other assets, leading to dips in broader markets.  If $TRUMP continues to moon, it might validate the concept of high-profile political or celebrity memecoins, paving the way for more launches. $ELON could go either way, but without Musk’s direct support, it seems far more speculative.  What do you think? Will $TRUMP and $ELON disrupt the memecoin landscape, or will this hype fizzle out?","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/MemecoinsOnSui - r/MemecoinMoonshots - r/SolanaNFT  Also check out the official discord for r/Memecoins: https://discord.gg/YM9sSDbsBh  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The community and team behind PEIRO is full of hard working people and fun to be around, a work hard/play hard mentality.   PEIRO hosted a spaces today with Baby NEIRO and Nitefeeder. Last week they hosted a space with NEIRO CTO (just listed on binance) and KENDU. its clear $PEIRO has connections and a smart team. All of these other coins are in the multi millions, which shows where PEIRO is headed IMO.   PEIRO reached an ATH over 600K, and the chart looks fantastic, indicating it’s ready for a breakout. Additionally, they’ve announced the upcoming launch of testing for a memecoin/crypto-related app in October, which will be utilized by major names and communities in the crypto space, more info on that will come.   PEIRO also donated 15K to charity. Donating 10K to Bob Burnquist's charity (OG skateboarder with ties to Tony Hawk) and 5K to Doge Pound's chariy. All of the proof/interactions can be found on PEIRO X account.   The team is incredibly friendly and actively engaged on both Telegram and X.

MemeCoins,Gnocchi - The viral Shiba Inu,https://i.redd.it/ewn7ke0w7aje1.jpeg,2/15/2025,4,"Hey you, stop scrolling. You might have just stumbled on something epic- a viral Reddit post on r/shiba that dropped some godlike lore and sparked our journey. This isn’t just another meme; it’s the origin story of what could be the next big memecoin.  In that post, our very own Gnocchi - yes, the pup that kinda looks like Doge - was celebrated in a way that felt pure and authentic. The post is upvoting like crazy and it’s amazing to see how one fun meme evolved into something bigger.  What’s really cool? The owner of the adorable Shiba Inu is one of us - a genuine community member and a proud Gnocchi holder. No suits, no slick campaigns - just real people with real passion.  We’re not about hype or fancy marketing. We’re all about keeping it raw, honest, and community-driven. Every like, share, and upvote reminds us why we’re in this together.  Tying our journey to one of the top posts on r/shiba is a huge nod to what happens when the internet unites. It’s a reminder that the best things are often the ones we build ourselves.

MemeCoins,My $HEGE Manifesto,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ia5320,1/26/2025,6,"A story of my journey in crypto and why I call $Hege home. I started off by playing games to earn stats (Bitcoin) to have some side income. I got to about 25$ and saw the dollar value change dramatically through the days and thought what tf is going on. Ok it's time to pull out my cash, how? They tell me to download Coin Base, ok that's alot of verification, weird? I completed the process and found my self in a completely different world, Doge, Pepe, wtf is this. I figure out how transferring works and now I have 25$ in Bitcoin, watching my balance slightly fluctuate for a couple of days I did ridiculous amounts of research. I decided Bitcoin wasn't going to get me any where with 25$ so I transfer to Pepe and Doge thinking I'd be easy to multiple what I had, no, still overall stagnant for a couple days. XRP goes up like 100% and I get in with my 25$ at 1.30$ in a couple days and turned into a XRP fan boy, it went up to 1.75$ and pulled about 180$ from the bank into XRP a day later it jumped to 2.30$, I held on to 2.90$ thinking it was going to ATH easily. It dropped to 2.40$ and I thought it's fine it'll be there soon. A couple or so weeks of waiting 60 Minutes dropped there episode on crypto, watching it go up from the past couple days it crashed extremely fast. My average entry was about 1.70$ I thought O yea I'm safe, I then realized if I sell I can get in at a better price, so I pull out all my XRP 203$. Here is my list of transactions all being my full account balance. Sold at 2.07$, buy at 2.18$, sell at 2.13$ and finally buy at 2.19$. I then make my self stop looking at the chart, I held and luckily it stayed at around 2.30$ after a couple of days. I got to experience both side of the bull run , up and down, some schizophrenia, more experience, and 20$ out of my account. I held for another week while looking more in to crypto and eventually meme coins, I think it's easy mony so I download Coin Base wallet and start buying a few random thing. I come along Hege and love the community so I put in 20$ at about .05$ thinking this was going to be great, I watched it go down but the community was stellar so I held. I go deeper by downloading Phantom Wallet and get rug pulled a few times overall losing money. Eventually I get Bull X Neo and do some paper trading and hit it on the head 3 times, I thought I was a God. I sart trading and getting rug pulled multiple times, I continued and lost about 50$. In that time I started finding out about bundle buys and wallet tracking, I felt like I was in the matrix finding out there's people with hundreds of thousands of dollars manipulating charts and completely fabricating some, I became scared and lost. I new it was gambling to a sense but didn't now how deep the rabbit hole went. Felling defeated I took a break for a few days to catch up on lost sleep. In that time I find out Trump made a coin and thought I missed out on generational wealth, I would maniacally laugh then lay on the cold floor, I later find out the earliest prices you could reasonably get in was like 3$ or 7$ or something so I felt better.   Ok ok anyway I now have around 95% of my crypto money in $Hege and the other 5% in incase a God event happens. So given my past 4 months of crypto experience here's a list of things I learned.  1. Community is absolutely necessary to follow through on the hard times, I couldn't hold onto XRP because I didn't like the community, I felt like they didn't work together and were all only money hungry, I had no connection and didn't feel comfortable.   Hege excelles on community more than any other, I feel extremely comfortable in the community and can see the extreme potential.  2. Dev team, these are the people who can open new doors to give a Coin more potential. The Dev team are making ads, opening new cex listings and every thing in between it feels. They clearly love the community and look to do everything in there power to ensure Hege succeeds.  3. Value, Hege's most valuable aspect is the dimond handed community and there extreme dedication to succeed, Hege is many people's conviction play and we actually injoy trying to get you guys to join because we believe deeply in Hege's success and want you to come with us and be apart of the community. Join us at r/hegecoin and find the telegraph, it's an excellent community in all aspects.  If your loosing money like I was it's likely because you betting on things with low or no value, most Coin's (like 99.5%) are traps that harness your delusions of grandeur, trust me I know.  4. Timing the market can definitely be beneficial but is a great way to miss out on great opportunities, right now hege is in the worst time to try and time an entry because we're in the consolidation stage after a great pump from a couple months ago. Remember no one knows the date or the hour of when any Coin will go up or how much, I feel confident I can assure you right now is an excellent buying opportunity and that it will go much higher than the ATH.  5. Whales beleve in the progect and have donated 400,000$ for advertising, this is the only time I've seen something like this. It's a clear indicator that they believe that this project will be worth much much more than its current value. Remember whales got alot of there money from being smart and I would assume that this was also a generous gift because they see the excellent community and Dev team.  These funds are getting deployed shortly, it will undoubtedly help the progect immensely with advertising and new cex listings, for a complete list look at the first photo.  For the new and old investors I hope this message finds you well and in a good spot to invest.

It's based on the legendary longcat meme born way back in 2002, giving it a massive network and history.  I'm still digging into the details, but so far I'm impressed. 4chan days were IT  **Admittedly, it started as a FOMO buy, but now I'm invested (pun intended!)**  I saw the LONG cat meme everywhere and decided to jump in.  Now that I'm researching more, I love the project's origins and what they're building.  The dev is a Pepe millionaire, which is pretty cool, and the project's been around for a few months now.  ""The cat stays long"" is their catchy phrase, and I can see it going viral. Anyone else here into Nobiko? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this project.  What are your insights?  Is it a good investment?  **Here's what excites me about Nobiko:**  -**Solid Community:  The Nobiko fam is strong and dedicated, just like the meme itself.  Don't be surprised to bump into Travladd in the Telegram chat! -**Unique Features:  Based on the OG longcat meme from 4chan – way before Doge even existed! -**Long-Term Potential:  With the market potentially bottoming and Nobiko's strong foundation, this could be a great long-term hold, especially at 1.1 million market cap.  The upside is crazy!  **Is Nobiko a Buy? DYOR (but seriously, check it out!)**  Ultimately, it's your call.  But with big influencers, a Pepe dev, and the most OG meme in crypto, Nobiko is definitely worth a look.

To show our gratitude for his tireless efforts, I’ll step back and let his heartfelt message to the $Oscar community speak for itself—celebrating an incredible 3-day, $7K fundraiser milestone!    Thank you, Ryu!  ————————————  Ryu:   Frens, I have no words to express my gratitude for this incredible community. Who else would do this? In just three days, we raised $7K—this is amazing!  I will provide more updates soon—this will be a huge week for OSCAR!!!  I also want to mention that our audit for $Collar is well advanced, and we should finalize and launch the mainnet this week. Our integration with Shibarium is also progressing, meaning we are close to achieving our first major goals since this CTO was launched!  All of this will be crowned with an incredible partnership with a top-tier exchange (T1) and a campaign reaching over 40 million users! Additionally, we are in discussions and exploring possibilities with many other CEXs, including another potential T1 exchange.  None of this would be possible without the strength, determination, and resilience of each and every one of you here!!! We have proven that a community-driven and fully decentralized token can truly build incredible things, help people and animals, and deliver an ecosystem that will create wealth and prosperity for our community. This will undoubtedly establish us as one of the biggest charity projects in the world.  Furthermore, we are delivering Doge Rebase—the great dream of Ryoshi—which is something no one has ever managed to build before! This token represents far more than just a token—it is a true community of builders and visionaries!  I am proud to be a part of this!

MemeCoins,Degens Doing Good- $PEIRO ,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1fr3ei7/degens_doing_good_peiro/,9/28/2024,16,"**Hello, Reddit!**  $PEIRO is generating a lot of buzz and is showing tremendous potential. $PEIRO is a new memecoin (3 weeks old) that’s taking off, serving as a community token that honors the two biggest memes of this cycle—PEPE and NEIRO.  Currently, $PEIRO has a market cap of around $600K and 394 holders. PEIRO is laying a solid foundation and is following the roadmap down to a tee, just in time for the market to turn green and for the anticipated bull run. This is a long-term investment IMO and a special community to be apart of. The dev/team is actively pursuing new initiatives. One standout feature is $PEIRO’s commitment to community support; they’ve already donated $15K to various charities, including $5K to Doge Pound and $10K to the legendary skateboarder Bob Burnquist, who joined us today on Spaces along with Pawthereum. It was a great session!  The connections the $PEIRO team is forging are impressive. They’ve engaged with notable figures like NEIRO's CTO, Kendu, and Baby Neiro on their official X account, as well as other high-profile projects in the industry that have reached decamillion market caps. This networking is a strong indicator of promise for such a new, low-market coin, and I’m excited to see what partnerships are on the horizon. There is no doubt in my mind that $PEIRO is a multi million dollar memecoin.   Looking ahead, there are some thrilling events coming up. $PEIRO is set to host a Shib OG on Spaces, who has collaborated directly with Ryoshi. They’re also planning to launch an app—details are still under wraps, but it’s expected to boost $PEIRO’s visibility and value.  If you want to connect with a dedicated group of real people—no bots or nonsense (just a bit of degen fun sometimes)—join the Telegram. You’ll find a community of hardworking individuals ready to embark on this journey together.

SHIB ***then*** blew up, **also a dog**.  fast forward to present: **dogs are now memecoin staples**.  PEPE had **news** of a teen who made ***millions*** from 20 bucks, and the infringement lawsuit. thats ur headline   thus **PEPE became a staple**.  BONK, WIF, all these animal tokens theyre fueled by the family of DOGE + SHIB + PEPE’s hype at the start of the bullmarket which stabilized their position throughout the entire cycle, thus limiting potential peak-top gains/returns from this point onwards.  now **cats**. how did they make their way into the crypto meme space? cats got so viral during 2024 ***its no surprise*** that cats made their way from the irl memeworld into the crypto space hype.  the way i see it is **memes should be viral aaass fuuuuuqqqqq** ***before*** entering altcoin season.  the only strong contender imo is CHILLGUY - and i own a lot of diff coins ***including BOME*** PEPE and KENDU.  for now tho just humor me for a second rlly, lets take a look at the pumpamentals of CHILLGUY so far:  1. blew tf up **IRL** as a meme, became culture, ***then a generational movement*** of letting go when things dont go ur way.  2. everyone their moms and their dogs know chill guy at this point, yet none of em have ever been in the market before or even heard of crypto.   3. USA today crowned chill guy, ***the irl meme***, as top 10 memes of all 2024… **the bitch wasnt even out for two months and turned the entire years memespace!!!!**  4. landed headlines of copyright infringement (as PEPE did)  5. the meme crypto space is all about new **first time** investors. investors who ***know nothing about crypto***, never heard of “narratives” moving avg RSI values fair value gaps **nothing**.  ***again*** humor me for a sec and riddle me this; do you ***rlly*** think new ***first time*** investors who know **nothing** about crypto are gonna open a trading app, see the ***entire*** selection of foreign letters numbers and colors - alongside CHILLGUY - and ignore the **one thing** that acc made sense to them? these apps are **dizzying** and the array of selection will ***force*** first time investors to flock into **what** ***they*** **recognize** ***and*** **relate to**.  these ppl have their classmates, friends everywhere posting chill guy references **without even knowing** a thing about crypto, or that CHILLGUY is also a coin. they open instagram - chill guy. open stories, chill guy. its unstoppable cuz ***its memes*** and its culture. **and it makes no fkn sense**  remember, all these ***new*** first time investors will recognize CHILLGUY, then proceed to get a bag, which pumps. that initial pump incites fomo, which then fuels a secondary pump, **just** so a new bunch of other new investors fomo in right after; thus fueling the third pump - and the one after - and then after. after. ***after***. thats how a memecoins **vicious** parabolic moves even come to happen.  ive written another ***even more detailed*** thesis on DOGE/SHIB’s **perp/futures** beginnings - and how that was the main supporting catalyst to their pumps during alt season; and how it would impact CHILLGUYs journey to a mind boggling top no one had seen coming. **the thesis’ basis is all technical and facts based where you could do the same excruciating research and land in the same airport i landed in**. if you guys would like to give it a read ill post it. x  ly gang xx","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/MemecoinsOnSui - r/MemecoinMoonshots - r/SolanaNFT  Also check out the official discord for r/Memecoins: https://discord.gg/YM9sSDbsBh   *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am hearing things at $PEIRO are starting to pick up. The $PEIRO community continues to grow and holders continue to rise. Right now is an amazing entry to get into PEIRO IMO. This project is generating a lot of buzz in the crypto community, and it seems to have great potential and I can see some big partnerships coming.   In terms of connections, the team behind $PEIRO has hosted influential figures like NEIRO's CTO (Binance, 1B) , Kendu, and Baby Neiro on their official X account, along with other projects that have market caps in the millions or even hundreds of millions. This kind of networking is very bullish for such a new low-market coin, especially since they have an upcoming app called Alpha Drop coming out, this will all play a part in that.   Another thing I really appreciate about $PEIRO is its commitment to giving back. They’ve already donated almost $20K to charity, including $5K to Doge Pound NFT and $10K to Bob Burnquist, the legendary OG skateboarder.  Currently, $PEIRO has a market cap of around $300K and over 500 holders. The project is about 2 months old and building a solid foundation just in time for the upcoming bull run when the bitcoin dominance slows town and memes start to run.

MemeCoins,Hawk Tuah Girls Biggest Memecoin Holding is $NEIREI and Why This Matters,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1goxtma/hawk_tuah_girls_biggest_memecoin_holding_is/,11/11/2024,8,"Haliey Welch, also known as Hawk Tuah girl, recently [doxxed](https://x.com/bubblemaps/status/1854609546695843841) her wallets, including her **Ethereum wallet** that can be found [here](https://debank.com/profile/0x713330395614441DceF0FeD76887B5f01f52f5d8).  Her top holdings consist of **$NEIREI at number one**, followed by $BRETT at number two and a few other random memecoins.  https://preview.redd.it/71x08v2e5b0e1.png?width=2072&format=png&auto=webp&s=686e82dae7abe9cd8555ae998c745feb6ac83118  NeiRei, the Chinese version of $NEIRO, recently hit an all-time high of **$7 million in market cap** and has since consolidated nicely at **around $2.2 million**. With Neiro breaking past a **$1 billion market cap**, it’s only logical to expect that NeiRei, the top derivative of Neiro, is ready for a breakout.  To put it in perspective, $PEIPEI, the Chinese derivative of $PEPE, reached an ATH of **$170 million, approximately 4% of Pepe's ATH market cap**. By comparison, NeiRei is currently sitting at just **0.2% of Neiro’s market cap**. This leaves massive potential for growth. If NeiRei were to hit just **4% of Neiro’s market cap**, it would mean a 20x pump. Even reaching 1% would give a 5x, and that's highly likely at this point, especially as Bitcoin continues to break **ATH after ATH**.  Neiro's run to $1+ billion was largely driven by a **Binance spot listing**. However, Hawk Tuah's [tweet](https://x.com/HalieyWelchX/status/1846264142065176661) after Neiro made a donation to her charity, Paws Across America, also played a role. NeiRei’s community is following Neiro's path with plans to **support her charity as well**. With NeiRei being Hawk Tuah’s largest memecoin holding, I wouldn't be surprised if she shows her support for NeiRei as well! A NeiRei rally is primed at this point!  Furthermore, the **$MUMU content team** is currently working on a **high-quality animated short** featuring NeiRei and Hawk Tuah at a Mets game. That should be released within the next few days!  # Whale Activity  There has been numerous [millionaires](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1fjaup3/millionaires_started_swapping_neiro_into_neirei/) that continue to accumulate NeiRei. It's as if they know what's coming. ;)  # Burns  So far, there has been about $70k worth of NeiRei tokens and liquidity burns.

MemeCoins,Meme Coins to Buy Before the Next Bull Run,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1er0wnw/meme_coins_to_buy_before_the_next_bull_run/,8/13/2024,1,"Meme coins rule the crypto market, and some made a definite splash in 2024. They have risen from unknown to becoming an all-time favorite for retail investors. The next big crypto 1 billion hit is around the corner, and it seems the perfect time to invest in meme coins and get massive returns.  I have invested and listed the top 5 meme coins that will rock the crypto market this August.   For me, it is:   ***#1. $Selfie (To be 1B Market cap)***  As per expert opinion, SelfieDogCoin (SELFIE) is going to be one of the topmost meme coins to hit the crypto market this August.  It has gathered a lively community of dog enthusiasts, which is an important factor contributing to the success of meme coins. Strong community support is believed to drive ongoing demand and trading volume.  Additionally, operating on the Solana blockchain means SELFIE benefits from fast, low-cost transactions, strengthening its position for traders. The coin has shown healthy market activity, with over $4 million in 24-hour trading volume, further leading to price stability and growth.  And to your surprise, a remarkable increase of over 6000% from its all-time low has been estimated, highlighting a beneficial market interest and possibilities for further gains. With the growing demand for meme coins in the crypto world, Selfie has created a hype on social media. It is definitely going to extract noteworthy gains and will be a standout investment for crypto enthusiasts in 2024  ***#2. $Doge***  Dogecoin, a popular meme coin featuring the famous Shiba Inu dog, has reached a remarkable position in the crypto world and is set to reach a market cap of $1 billion. With a current market cap of around $18 billion, Dogecoin has already pacified its position in the cryptocurrency market.  Doge has gained an unbelievable community support and endorsements from influential figures like Elon Musk. The coin's popularity develops from its lighthearted and inclusive approach, differentiating it from other popular cryptocurrencies.  Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin doesn't have a defined limit on the overall number of coins that can be generated; thus, it can be easily accessed by many people all around the globe. Additionally, Dogecoin's low transaction fees and fast processing times make it an attractive option for microtransactions and online tipping.  As of August 2024, Dogecoin has a circulating supply of 142 billion DOGE at a price of $0.1292. With a 24-hour trading volume of $839 million and a year-to-date increase of 28%, Dogecoin's all-time growing rate shows no signs of slowing down.  If this trend continues, the possibility of Dogecoin, a beloved and influential meme coin, reaching the $1 billion market in the coming future is sure.   ***#3. $Billy***   Billy ($BILLY), a trending meme coin on the Solana blockchain, could soon hit a $1 billion market cap. Currently, Billy has a market cap of around $90 million with a circulating supply of 936 million tokens and a price of about $0.096.  It has recently crossed the 150% mark, as shown on major exchanges like Bitrue and Gate.io listings, which have boosted its liquidity and visibility. Why is Billy attracting so much attention? Billy has reached the zenith of success as it possesses a community-driven approach and is mainly surrounded by a playful meme culture.  Since its launch in June 2024, it has been ruling the crypto market, especially as older meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have faced declines. With a trading volume of around $25 million, Billy's intense market activity suggests it is a top contender to invest in for continued growth. Is Billy going to touch the assumed 1 billion market cap? Given its recent performance and growing investor interest, it’s definitely a possibility.  Billy's recent trading volume of about $25 million reflects strong investor interest and engagement. The coin's ability to beat others in a bearish trading market highlights its unique position and valued potential for upcoming growth.   ***#4. $Bonk***   Bonk ($BONK) is another meme coin that has gained popularity in recent years. Its decentralized, community-driven model on the Solana blockchain has already crossed a $1 billion market cap, currently around $1.43 billion.  The coin’s unique approach—having no central team or governance—has struck a chord with investors, who appreciate its grassroots, community-driven factors. Recent trading volume is over $25 million, and despite a 24-hour price dip of -4.61%, investor interest remains unmatched.  What sets Bonk apart? Its value has risen due to its decentralized nature and the increasing popularity of the Solana network.  The goal to increase its user base by 500,000 could further boost demand and adoption. With these factors on demand, it appears Bonk will definitely be worth investing in for additional growth.  In April 2024, the Bonk DAO further fueled the coin’s growth by approving a massive burn of over 278 billion BONK tokens, which reduced its supply and spiked the price by 40% within a day. Additionally, BONK’s listing on major exchanges, including Revolut, Coinbase, Kraken, and others, has maintained its accessibility and mainstream legitimacy, contributing to its price explosion.   ***#5. $Ponke***   Ponke (PONKE) has become a standout meme coin on the Solana blockchain, known for its unmatched price swings and a playful persona as a “degenerate gambler with anger issues.” Since its inception, Ponke has seen dramatic price changes, peaking at $0.08 on December 25, 2023, and dropping to $0.01 on January 3, 2024. As of January 2024, Ponke is trading around $0.061, reflecting a 29.9% increase in 24 hours and a 135.5% rise over the past week.  Analysts have noted that Ponke exhibits a bullish structure, suggesting a rapid explosion in the price as it breaks out of previous resistance levels. Currently priced at approximately $0.394, Ponke has a market cap of around $40.48 million and recently reached an all-time high of $0.67440, reflecting a 7,173.4% increase from its all-time low of $0.00928.  Ponke ranks amongst the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the meme coin world, where its value has risen mainly based on memes and community hype rather than practical usage. However, the coin exhibits a volatile nature, combined with its cultural appeal, and has gathered a lot of attention, including a nod from veteran investor Davinci Jeremie.  Ponke is traded on six markets, with Raydium being the most active exchange. Despite its few risks and lack of a clear use case, Ponke's strong community and viral memes keep it in the spotlight, making it a popular meme coin of the crypto scene.","Thank you for your submission on r/Memecoins, Join Crypto Other Subreddits:  - r/OreSupply - r/SolanaNFT  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

IMO this is an amazing buying opportunity at these levels, especially with whats to come.   There’s a major secret project in the works, along with an app that’s set to boost the value of PEIRO. The app is based in Brooklyn, NY. This crypto/memecoin-focused social media app will verify users' holdings, meaning you can only shill/promote coins you actually own. This innovative approach is expected to attract many prominent coins, communities and KOLs into the mix.  🤝  Additionally, PEIRO has already hosted significant names on their X spaces, including NEIRO's CTO, Kendu, Doggo, and Baby Neiro, showcasing the team's impressive connections, with many more connections/people/groups that will get involved over time. For me, this is bullish for PEIRO and also the app, in the end it will continue to bring eyes and more value to PEIRO.   What’s truly commendable is the PEIRO team’s commitment to giving back, donating over $17K to various charities, including Bob Burnquist's  charity, Doge Pound NFTs charity, support for K9 dogs, and hurricane relief efforts in North Carolina. The team has a goal to donate over 1 million by 2025. For me, I love seeing the team do good, but its also a great opportunity to get involved and be apart of a coin that continues to grow and increase in value.

MemeCoins,$PEIRO wants degens who mean well,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1fmirdx/peiro_wants_degens_who_mean_well/,9/22/2024,12,"Raise your hand if you've been: - rugged - honeypotted - in an early project where the team couldn't produce - joined an ATH and are now sitting much, much lower - were part of a community that was focused on PVP - were in projects that didn't help anybody but themselves  Ask yourself why that is? Are you buying into the trending lists, or following callers that keep giving you bad tips? $PEIRO strives to be different on all these fronts.  To start with the most important, Peiros goal is to make life better for animals. It does so by donating to charities such as animals shelters. At only about 2 weeks old Peiro has already donated $10K to Bob Burnquist's charity and another $5K to Doge Poujd NFT's shelter. The donations will continue to happen as peiro has sell fees (currently 0.1%/1%) which go to a charity wallet, as well as other to be revealed ways to fund the donations.  Peiro is also looking to foster a collaborative environment in the defi space. It has already hosted 2 twitter spaces, the first with Kendu, Neiro CTO and Doge Pound NFT, and the second was with Nitefeeder and Gou (with a surprise visit from Kendu).  The goal behind these spaces is to give a space for projects to share what they are doing, but also to build relationships across different communities which can be useful later on (such as making join donations, etc).  The final selling point is that this community was formed by a gang of degens who needed a different channel to hang out in with slightly less moderation, and it's quite a blast 😜.  I hope you all have a great day and invite you to reach out if any of this interests you or your project.

And an open and crystal clear team too,"One thing I like to point out is how well received the team is. Most of the people that joined up initially did so  because they heard of the dev from Kendu. When I saw the guys tweet that was legit all I needed to know to ape some into this. I think there are others that feel this way as well and that's probably the driving factor behind our initial leg up to $600k+, not fundamentals or the project itself but the people behind it.  I have no regrets as they delivered much more bullish news than I could have ever expected for these first couple of weeks and it just keeps coming it seems. At this point I'm genuinely unsure on how they could make me more bullish on the project. don't believe me? Check out the TG and Twitter yourself at least.",Great post my man! PEIRO is different compared to any project I have ever been in. I am so bullish not going to lie. I am pumped for whats to come. I highly suggest anyone reading this to come hang and check out the TG.,$PEIRO is an uncut gem. Once its entire ecosystem is laid out it will be too late because it will be in the deca millions heading for 100M. See the beauty in what this team is doing. All of these connections and partnerships with 100+M MC projects is not a coincidence.. 🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕,0.2732,0.9944,0.7184,0.4389,-0.6908,0.6588,0.5859,2.9788,35.7456
